  sets",,,,"Stony Brook IMS 1991/7","math.DS",,"  It is shown that the boundary of the Mandelbrot set $M$ has Hausdorff
dimension two and that for a generic $c \in \bM$, the Julia set of $z \mapsto
z^2+c$ also has Hausdorff dimension two. The proof is based on the study of the
bifurcation of parabolic periodic points.
