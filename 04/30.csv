"math/9201226",,"Jes\'us Bastero and Francisco J. Ruiz","Interpolation of operators when the extreme spaces are $L^\infty$",,,,"Banach Archive 4/29/91","math.FA",,"  In this paper, equivalence between interpolation properties of linear
operators and monotonicity conditions are studied, for a pair $(X_0,X_1)$ of
rearrangement invariant quasi Banach spaces, when the extreme spaces of the
interpolation are $L^\infty$ and a pair $(A_0,A_1)$ under some assumptions.
Weak and restricted weak intermediate spaces fall in our context. Applications
to classical Lorentz and Lorentz-Orlicz spaces are given.
