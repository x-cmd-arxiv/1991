"math/9201283","Jacek Graczyk","Jacek Graczyk, Grzegorz Swiatek","Critical circle maps near bifurcation",,,,"Stony Brook IMS 1991/8","math.DS",,"  We estimate harmonic scalings in the parameter space of a one-parameter
family of critical circle maps. These estimates lead to the conclusion that the
Hausdorff dimension of the complement of the frequency-locking set is less than
$1$ but not less than $1/3$. Moreover, the rotation number is a H\""{o}lder
continuous function of the parameter.
