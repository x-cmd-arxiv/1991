described. It is defined by a finite-difference-differential equation
generating in the limiting cases the Rosen-Morse, harmonic, and P\""oschl-Teller
potentials. General solution includes Shabat's infinite number soliton system
and leads to raising and lowering operators satisfying $q$-deformed harmonic
oscillator algebra. In the latter case energy spectrum is purely exponential
and physical states form a reducible representation of the quantum conformal
algebra $su_q(1,1)$.
