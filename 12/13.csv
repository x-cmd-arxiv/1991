general $(p,q)$ minimal models coupled to gravity are calculated in the
continuum approach. On one hand, the result agrees with the unitary series
($q=p+1$); and on the other hand, for $p=2, q=2k-1$, we find agreement with the
one-matrix model results.

1991 Trieste Spring School on String Theory and Quantum Gravity. The subject is
the construction of supersymmetric soliton solutions to superstring theory. A
brief review of solitons and instantons in supersymmetric theories is
presented. Yang-Mills instantons are then used to construct soliton solutions
to heterotic string theory of various types. The structure of these solutions
is discussed using low-energy field theory, sigma-model arguments, and in one
case an exact construction of the underlying superconformal field theory.
