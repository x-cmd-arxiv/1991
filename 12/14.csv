trajectory between two conformal field theories. Specifically, we investigate a
perturbation of the A3 superconformal minimal model such that in the infrared
limit the theory flows to the A2 model. The correlation functions in the
topological sector of the theory are computed numerically along the trajectory,
and these results are compared to the expected asymptotic behavior. Excellent
agreement is found, and the characteristic features of the infrared theory,
including the central charge and the normalized operator product expansion
coefficients are obtained. We also review and discuss some aspects of the
geometrical description of N=2 supersymmetric quantum field theories recently
uncovered by S. Cecotti and C. Vafa.

minimal conformal field theory M_p with p >> 1. To leading order in
perturbation theory, we find a unique one-parameter family of ``hopping
trajectories'' that is characterized by a staircase-like renormalization group
flow of the C-function and the anomalous dimensions and that is related to a
recently solved factorizable scattering theory. We argue that this system is
described by interactions of the form t phi_{(1,3)} - t' \phi_{(3,1)} . As a
function of the relevant parameter t, it undergoes a phase transition with new
critical exponents simultaneously governed by all fixed points M_p, M_{p-1},
..., M_3. Integrable lattice models represent different phases of the same
integrable system that are distinguished by the sign of the irrelevant
parameter t'.
