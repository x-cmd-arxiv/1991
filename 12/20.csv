theory of the $c=1$ matrix model. We derive exact Ward identities relating
correlation functions of the bilocal operator. These identities can be
expressed as equations satisfied by the effective action of a {\it three}
dimensional theory and contain non-perturbative information about the model. We
use these identities to calculate the two point function of the bilocal
operator in the double scaling limit. We extract the operator whose two point
correlator has a {\it single} pole at an (imaginary) integer value of the
energy. We then rewrite the \winf~ charges in terms of operators in the matrix
model and use this derive constraints satisfied by the partition function of
the matrix model with a general time dependent potential.

subgroup can lead to analogues of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. At sufficiently low
momentum, the cross-section for scattering of a particle with nontrivial $\Z_2$
charge off a global vortex is almost equal to (but definitely different from)
maximal Aharonov-Bohm scattering; the effect goes away at large momentum. The
scattering of a spin-1/2 particle off a magnetic vortex provides an amusing
experimentally realizable example.

that can be naturally understood from the point of view of topological field
theory. Basically this involves studying the topological field theories made by
twisting $N=2$ sigma models. This is mainly a review of old results, except for
the discussion in \S7 of certain facts that may be relevant to constructing the
``mirror map'' between mirror moduli spaces.

functions. The differential operators are completely determined by recursion
relations from the Schwinger-Dyson equations. Interesting observation is that
these generating operators of the one-point functions satisfy
$W_{1+\infty}$-like algebra. Also, we obtain constraint equations on the
partition functions in terms of the differential operators. These constraint
equations on the partition functions define the symmetries of the matrix models
at off-critical point before taking the double scaling limit.

the matrix models and to 2-dimensional quantum gravity which is defined as
their continuum limit. The results concerning multi-loop correlators for low

the Kontsevich matrix model which is equivalent to 2-dimensional topological
gravity. I review the Schwinger--Dyson equations for the Kontsevich model as
well as their explicit solution in genus zero. The relation between the
Kontsevich model and the continuum limit of the hermitean one-matrix model is
discussed.

space reconcile quantum mechanics with general relativity, thanks to an
infinite set of conserved quantum numbers, ``W-hair'', associated with
topological soliton-like states. In this paper we extend these arguments to
four dimensions, by considering explicitly the case of string black holes with
radial symmetry. The key infinite-dimensional W-symmetry is associated with the
$\frac{SU(1,1)}{U(1)}$ coset structure of the dilaton-graviton sector that is a
model-independent feature of spherically symmetric four-dimensional strings.
Arguments are also given that the enormous number of string {\it discrete
(topological)} states account for the maintenance of quantum coherence during
the (non-thermal) stringy evaporation process, as well as quenching the large
Hawking-Bekenstein entropy associated with the black hole. Defining the latter
as the measure of the loss of information for an observer at infinity, who -
ignoring the higher string quantum numbers - keeps track only of the classical
mass,angular momentum and charge of the black hole, one recovers the familiar a
quadratic dependence on the black-hole mass by simple counting arguments on the
asymptotic density of string states in a linear-dilaton background.
