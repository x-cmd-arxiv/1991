theory with duality symmetric ``matter'' following recent paper with C. Vafa
(HUTP-91/A049). We consider two models : when the matter action is the
classical action of the fields corresponding to momentum and winding modes and
when the matter action is represented by the quantum vacuum energy of the
string compactified on a torus. Assuming that the effective vacuum energy is
positive one finds that in both cases the scale factor undergoes oscillations
from maximal to minimal values with the amplitude of oscillations decreasing to
zero or increasing to infinity depending on whether the effective coupling
(dilaton field) decreases or increases with time. The contribution of the
winding modes to the classical action prevents infinite expansion. Duality is
``spontaneously broken'' on a solution with generic initial conditions.

conformally self-dual metrics. It reduces to integrals over the conformal
factor and over the moduli space of conformally self--dual metrics and can be
studied with the methods of two dimensional quantum gravity in conformal gauge.
The conformal anomaly induces an analog of the Liouville action. The proposal
of David, Distler and Kawai is generalized to four dimensions. Critical
exponents and the analog of the c=1 barrier of two dimensional gravity are
derived. Connections with Weyl gravity and four dimensional topological gravity
are suggested.

theories is reported. It is shown if such a theory has any spin-1 currents, it
is either the Leech lattice CFT, or it can be written as a tensor product of
Kac-Moody algebras with total central charge 24. The total number of
combinations of Kac-Moody algebras for which meromorphic $c=24$ theories may
exist is 221. The next step towards classification is to obtain all modular
invariant combinations of Kac-Moody characters. The presently available results
are sufficient to obtain a complete list of all ten-dimensional heterotic
strings. Furthermore there are strong indications for the existence of several
(probably at least 20) new meromorphic $c=24$ theories.

some single particle poles.
