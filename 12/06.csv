in string theory and show that the requirement of modular invariance
necessitates the nonvanishing of certain Nth order nonrenormalizable terms. In
a class of models (free fermionic formulation) we explicitly verify that the
nontrivial structure imposed by the modular invariance is indeed present.
Alternatively, we argue that after proper field redefinition, nonrenormalizable
terms can be recast as to display their invariance under the modular group. We
also discuss the phenomenological implications of the above observations.

the de Rham complex and Riemannian geometry of some underlying moduli space
$\cal M$ and the partition function equals the Euler number of $\cal M$. We
explicitly deal with moduli spaces of instantons and of flat connections in two
and three dimensions.
  To motivate our constructions we explain the relation between the
Mathai-Quillen formalism and supersymmetric quantum mechanics and introduce a
new kind of supersymmetric quantum mechanics based on the Gauss-Codazzi
equations. We interpret the gauge theory actions from the Atiyah-Jeffrey point
of view and relate them to supersymmetric quantum mechanics on spaces of
connections. As a consequence of these considerations we propose the Euler
number of the moduli space of flat connections as a generalization to arbitrary
three-manifolds of the Casson invariant. We also comment on the possibility of
constructing a topological version of the Penner matrix model.

  the $r$-Matrix Type","24 pages",,,,"hep-th",,"  For a large class of hierarchies of integrable equations admitting a
classical $r-$matrix, we propose a construction for the Virasoro algebra
actionon the Lax operators which commutes with the hierarchy flows. The
construction relies on the existence of dressing transformations associated to
the $r$-matrix and does not involve the notion of a tau function. The
dressing-operator form of the Virasoro action gives the corresponding
formulation of the Virasoro constraints on hierarchies of the $r-$matrix type.
We apply the general construction to several examples which include KP, Toda
and generalized KdV hierarchies, the latter both in scalar and the
Drinfeld-Sokolov formalisms. We prove the consistency of Virasoro action on the
scalar and matrix (Drinfeld-Sokolov) Lax operators, and make an observation on
the difference in the form of string equations in the two formalisms.
