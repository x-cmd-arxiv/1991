four dimensions. After a brief discussion of the global properties of the
metric, we discuss the stability of the background with respect to small
perturbations, following the methods of Gilbert and of Chandrasekhar. The
potential for axial perturbations is found to be positive definite.

"hep-th/9112003",,"Shin'ichi Nojiri","Non-perturbative Aspect of Zero Dimensional Supersring","9pages e-mail address : insth1::nojiri or nojiri%insth1.hepnet@lbl",,,,"hep-th",,"  We discuss the non-perturbative aspect of zero dimensional superstring. The
perturbative expansions of correlation functions diverge as
$\sum_l(3l)!\kappa^{2l}$, where $\kappa$ is a string coupling constant. This
implies there are non-perturbative contributions of order $\e^{C\kappa^{-{2
\over 3}}}$. (Here $C$ is a constant.) This situation contrasts with those of
critical or non-critical bosonic strings, where the perturbative expansions
diverge as $\sum_ll!\kappa^{2l}$ and non-perturbative behaviors go as
$\e^{C\kappa^{-1}}$. It is explained how such nonperturbative effects of order
$\e^{C\kappa^{-{2 \over 3}}}$ appear in zero dimensional superstring theory.
Due to these non-perturbative effects, the supersymmetry in target space breaks
down spontaneously.
