(WZNW) theory by first class Kac-Moody constraints is analyzed in detail. Lie
algebraic conditions are given for ensuring the presence of exact
integrability, conformal invariance and $\cal W$-symmetry in the reduced
theories. A Lagrangean, gauged WZNW implementation of the reduction is
established in the general case and thereby the path integral as well as the
BRST formalism are set up for studying the quantum version of the reduction.
The general results are applied to a number of examples. In particular, a
${\cal W}$-algebra is associated to each embedding of $sl(2)$ into the simple
Lie algebras by using purely first class constraints. The importance of these
$sl(2)$ systems is demonstrated by showing that they underlie the
$W_n^l$-algebras as well. New generalized Toda theories are found whose chiral
algebras are the ${\cal W}$-algebras belonging to the half-integral $sl(2)$
embeddings, and the ${\cal W}$-symmetry of the effective action of those
generalized Toda theories associated with the integral gradings is exhibited
explicitly.
