gauge theory interacting with gravity. We show that nonsingular monopole
solutions exist only if the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$ is less than or
equal to a critical value $v_{cr}$, which is of the order of the Planck mass.
In the limiting case the monopole becomes a black hole, with the region outside
the horizon described by the critical Reissner-Nordstrom solution. For
$v<v_{cr}$, we find additional solutions which are singular at $r=0$, but which
have this singularity hidden within a horizon. These have nontrivial matter
fields outside the horizon, and may be interpreted as small black holes lying
within a magnetic monopole. The nature of these solutions as a function of $v$
and of the total mass $M$ and their relation to the Reissner-Nordstrom
solutions is discussed.

KP hierarchy is a nonlinear deformation, called $\hat{W}_{\infty}$, of the
linear, centerless $W_{\infty}$ algebra. In this letter we present a free-field
realization for all generators of $\hat{W}_{\infty}$ in terms of two scalars as
well as an elegant generating function for the $\hat{W}_{\infty}$ currents in
the classical conformal $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ coset model. After quantization, a
quantum deformation of $\hat{W}_{\infty}$ appears as the hidden current algebra
in this model. The $\hat{W}_{\infty}$ current algebra results in an infinite
set of commuting conserved charges, which might give rise to $W$-hair for the
2d black hole arising in the corresponding string theory at level $k=9/4$.

harmonic space action describing self-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) theory are
analyzed. The geometrical structure that is revealed is closely related to the
twistor construction of instanton solutions. The theory gets no quantum
corrections and, despite having SDYM as its classical equation of motion, its S
matrix is trivial. It is therefore NOT the theory of the N=2 string. We also
discuss the 5-dimensional actions that have been proposed for SDYM.
