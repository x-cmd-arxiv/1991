the double cohomology of the string BRST and Felder BRST charges. We find that
states outside the primary conformal grid are related to the states of non-zero
ghost number by means of descent equations given by the double cohomology. Some
aspects of the Virasoro structure of the Liouville Fock space are studied. As a
consequence, states of non-zero ghost number are easily constructed by
``solving'' these descent equations. This enables us to map ghost number
conserving correlation functions involving non-zero ghost number states into
those involving states outside the primary conformal grid.
