distinct large $N$ limits, since two independent parameters govern the size of
the matrix. Regarded as models of random surfaces, these matrix models
interpolate between branched polymer behaviour and two-dimensional quantum
gravity. We solve such models in a `triple-scaling' regime in this paper, with
$N$ and $M$ becoming large independently. A correspondence between phase
transitions and singularities of mappings from ${\bf R}^2$ to ${\bf R}^2$ is
indicated. At different critical points, the scaling behavior is determined by:
i) two decoupled ordinary differential equations; ii) an ordinary differential
equation and a finite difference equation; or iii) two coupled partial
differential equations. The Painlev\'e II equation arises (in conjunction with
a difference equation) at a point associated with branched polymers. For
critical points described by partial differential equations, there are dual
weak-coupling/strong-coupling expansions. It is conjectured that the new
physics is related to microscopic topology fluctuations.

nonabelian cosmic strings (and vortices) in quantum field theory. Operators are
constructed that introduce classical string sources and that create dynamical
string loops. The operator construction in lattice gauge theory is explicitly
described, and correlation functions are computed in the strong--coupling and
weak--coupling limits. These correlation functions are used to study the
long--range interactions of nonabelian strings, taking account of
charge--screening effects due to virtual particles. Among the phenomena
investigated are the Aharonov--Bohm interactions of strings with charged
particles, holonomy interactions between string loops, string entanglement, the
transfer of ``Cheshire charge'' to a string loop, and domain wall decay via
spontaneous string nucleation. We also analyze the Aharonov--Bohm interactions
of magnetic monopoles with electric flux tubes in a confining gauge theory. We
propose that the Aharonov--Bohm effect can be invoked to distinguish among
various phases of a nonabelian gauge theory coupled to matter.

group of area-preserving diffeomorphisms on various surfaces is overviewed.
Roles of area-preserving diffeomorphisms in 4-d self-dual gravity are reviewed.
Recent progress in new members of this family, the SDiff(2) KP and Toda
hierarchies, is reported. The group of area-preserving diffeomorphisms on a
cylinder plays a key role just as the infinite matrix group GL($\infty$) does
in the ordinary KP and Toda lattice hierarchies. The notion of tau functions is
also shown to persist in these hierarchies, and gives rise to a central
extension of the corresponding Lie algebra.

symplectic structure and the group SDiff(2) of area preserving diffeomorphisms

introduced. The existence of hidden SDiff(2) symmetries are derived from a
Riemann-Hilbert problem in the SDiff(2) group. Symmetries of the tau function
turn out to have commutator anomalies, hence give a representation of a central
