(nonlocal) collective field theory, for finite~$N$. The Jacobian arising by
changing variables from matrix eigenvalues to their density distribution is
treated {\it exactly\/}. The semiclassical loop expansion turns out {\it not\/}
to coincide with the (topological) ${1\over N}$~expansion, because the
classical background has a non-trivial $N$-dependence. We derive a simple
integral equation for the classical eigenvalue density, which displays strong
non-perturbative behavior around $N\!=\!\infty$. This leads to IR singularities
in the large-$N$ expansion, but UV divergencies appear as well, despite
remarkable cancellations among the Feynman diagrams. We evaluate the free
energy at the two-loop level and discuss its regularization. A simple example
serves to illustrate the problems and admits explicit comparison with
orthogonal polynomial results.

group of area-preserving diffeomorphisms on a cylinder is proposed. An improved
Lax formalism of the KP hierarchy is shown to give a prototype of this new
hierarchy. Two important potentials, $S$ and $\tau$, are introduced. The latter
is a counterpart of the tau function of the ordinary KP hierarchy. A
Riemann-Hilbert problem relative to the group of area-diffeomorphisms gives a
twistor theoretical description (nonlinear graviton construction) of general
solutions. A special family of solutions related to topological minimal models
are identified in the framework of the Riemann-Hilbert problem. Further,
infinitesimal symmetries of the hierarchy are constructed. At the level of the
tau function, these symmetries obey anomalous commutation relations, hence
leads to a central extension of the algebra of infinitesimal area-preserving
diffeomorphisms (or of the associated Poisson algebra).
