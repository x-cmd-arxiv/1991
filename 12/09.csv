models following the quantum, stochastic, or $d=1$-like stabilization is
discussed in comparison with other procedures. We also present another
alternative definition, which illustrates the need of new physical input for
$d=0$ matrix models to make contact with 2D quantum gravity at the
non-perturbative level.
