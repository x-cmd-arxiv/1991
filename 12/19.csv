theories and consider orbifolds of these models with respect to abelian
symmetries. For LG--vacua described by potentials in which at most three
scaling fields are coupled we explicitly construct the chiral ring and discuss
its diagonalization with respect to its most general abelian symmetry. For
theories with couplings between at most two fields we present results of an
explicit construction of the LG--potentials and their orbifolds. The emerging
space of (2,2)--theories shows a remarkable mirror symmetry. It also contains a
number of new three--generation models.

large $N$ limits, at least perturbatively within the loop expansion, a property
they share with matrix models of 2D quantum gravity. In contrast with matrix
models, however, vector models can be solved in arbitrary dimensions. We
present here the analysis of field theory vector models in $d$ dimensions and
discuss the nature and form of the critical behaviour. The double scaling limit
corresponds for $d>1$ to a situation where a bound state of the $N$-component
fundamental vector field $\phi$, associated with the $\phi^2$ composite
operator, becomes massless, while the field $\phi$ itself remains massive. The
limiting model can be described by an effective local interaction for the
corresponding $O(N)$ invariant field. It has a physical interpretation as
describing the statistical properties of a class of branched polymers.\par It
is hoped that the $O(N)$ vector models, which can be investigated in their most
general form, can serve as a test ground for new ideas about the behaviour of
2D quantum gravity coupled with $d>1$ matter.

difficulties of the simplest supersymmetric grand unification schemes I
emphasize the distinct features of string unification. An important role in
constraining the effective low energy physics from strings is played by
$duality$ symmetries. The discussed topics include the unification of coupling
constants (computation of $\sin ^2\theta _W$ and $\alpha _s$ at the weak
scale), supersymmetry breaking through gaugino condensation, and properties of
the induced SUSY-breaking soft terms. I remark that departures from
universality in the soft terms are (in contrast to the minimal SUSY model)
generically expected.

to Virasoro constraints. The construction is based on a generalization of the
Kontsevich parametrization of the KP times by introducing Miwa parameters into
it. The resulting Kontsevich--Miwa transform can be applied to the Virasoro
constraints provided the Miwa parameters are related to the background charge
$Q$ of the Virasoro generators on the hierarchy. We then recover the field
content of the David-Distler-Kawai formalism, with the matter theory
represented by a scalar with the background charge $Q_m=Q-{Q\over 2}$. In
particular, the tau function is related to the correlator of a product of the
`21' operators of the minimal model with central charge $d=1-3Q_m^2$.

this symmetry explains the presence of a spectral parameter in the solutions of

the associated tetrahedron equations, there also exists an infinite discrete
group of symmetry. Although generalizing naturally the previous one, it is a
much bigger hyperbolic Coxeter group. We indicate how this symmetry can help to
resolve the Yang-Baxter equations and their higher-dimensional generalizations
and initiate the study of three-dimensional vertex models. These symmetries are
naturally represented as birational projective transformations. They may
preserve non trivial algebraic varieties, and lead to proper parametrizations
of the models, be they integrable or not. We mention the relation existing
between spin models and the Bose-Messner algebras of algebraic combinatorics.
Our results also yield the generalization of the condition $q^n=1$ so often
mentioned in the theory of quantum groups, when no $q$ parameter is available.
