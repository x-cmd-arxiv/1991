representing the Euler characteristic of moduli spaces ${\cal M}$ of
connections, from supersymmetric quantum mechanics on the infinite dimensional
spaces ${\cal A}/{\cal G}$ of gauge orbits. To that end we discuss variants of
ordinary supersymmetric quantum mechanics which have meaningful extensions to
infinite-dimensional target spaces and introduce supersymmetric quantum
mechanics actions modelling the Riemannian geometry of submersions and
embeddings, relevant to the projections ${\cal A}\rightarrow {\cal A}/{\cal G}$
and inclusions ${\cal M}\subset{\cal A}/{\cal G}$ respectively. We explain the
relation between Donaldson theory and the gauge theory of flat connections in
$3d$ and illustrate the general construction by other $2d$ and $4d$ examples.

correspond to a vortex sitting at the horizon of a black hole. We find the
asymptotic behaviours, at the horizon and at infinity, of vortex solutions for
the gauge and scalar fields in an abelian Higgs model on a Euclidean
Schwarzschild background and interpolate between them by integrating the
equations numerically. Calculating the backreaction shows that the effect of
the vortex is to cut a slice out of the Euclidean Schwarzschild geometry.
Consequences of these solutions for black hole thermodynamics are discussed.

one-matrix model is determined. It is shown that the string equation is
equivalent to simple conditions on points $V_1$ and $V_2$ in the big cell $\Gr$
of the Sato Grassmannian $Gr$. This is a consequence of a well-defined
continuum limit in which the string equation has the simple form $\lb \cp
,\cq_- \rb =\hbox{\rm 1}$, with $\cp$ and $\cq_-$ $2\times 2$ matrices of
differential operators. These conditions on $V_1$ and $V_2$ yield a simple
system of first order differential equations whose analysis determines the
space of all solutions to the string equation. This geometric formulation leads
directly to the Virasoro constraints $\L_n\,(n\geq 0)$, where $\L_n$ annihilate
the two modified-KdV $\t$-functions whose product gives the partition function
of the Unitary Matrix Model.
