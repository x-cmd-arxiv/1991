extensions, and their contractions down to (super) w_\infty. Emphasis is put on
the field theoretic realisations of these algebras. We also review the
structure of w_\infty and W_\infty gravities and comment on various
applications of W_\infty symmetry.

complete. We study these spaces in the context of certain $N=2$ supergravity
theories, where dimensional reduction induces a mapping between {\em special}
real, K\""ahler and quaternionic spaces. The geometry of the real spaces is
encoded in cubic polynomials, those of the K\""ahler and quaternionic manifolds
in homogeneous holomorphic functions of second degree. We classify all cubic
polynomials that have an invariance group that acts transitively on the real
manifold. The corresponding K\""ahler and quaternionic manifolds are then
homogeneous. We find that they lead to a well-defined subset of the normal
quaternionic spaces classified by \Al\ (and the corresponding special K\""ahler
spaces given by Cecotti), but there is a new class of rank-3 spaces of
quaternionic dimension larger than 3. We also point out that some of the rank-4
\Al\ spaces were not fully specified and correspond to a finite variety of
inequivalent spaces. A simpler version of the equation that underlies the
classification of this paper also emerges in the context of $W_3$ algebras.

show how the underlying $N=2$ super-$w_\infty$ algebra gets deformed into an
$N=2$ super-$W_\infty$ algebra. Both algebras contain the $N=2$ super-Virasoro
algebra as a subalgebra. We discuss how one can extract from these results
information about quantum $N=2\ W_N$-supergravity theories containing a finite
number of higher-spin symmetries with superspin $s\le N$. As an example we
discuss the case of quantum $N=2\ W_3$-supergravity.
