solutions of D=10 supergravity admit the interpretation of non-singular
solitons even though, in the absence of Yang-Mills fields, they exhibit
curvature singularities at the origin. We answer the question using a test
probe/source approach, and find that the nature of the singularity is
probe-dependent. If the test probe and source are both superstrings or both
superfivebranes, one falls into the other in a finite proper time and the
singularity is real, whereas if one is a superstring and the other a
superfivebrane it takes an infinite proper time (the force is repulsive!) and
the singularity is harmless. Black strings and fivebranes, on the other hand,
always display real singularities.

semirigid geometry context. In particular, its topological nature is given by
the relation between deRham cohomology and equivariant BRST cohomology and the
fact that all but one of the physical operators are BRST-exact. The puncture
equation and the dilaton equation of pure topological gravity are reproduced,
following reference \dil.

  packing limit sets",,,,"Stony Brook IMS 1991/23","math.DG math.GT",,"  In this paper, we assume that $G$ is a finitely generated torsion free
non-elementary Kleinian group with $\Omega(G)$ nonempty. We show that the
maximal number of elements of $G$ that can be pinched is precisely the maximal
number of rank 1 parabolic subgroups that any group isomorphic to $G$ may
contain. A group with this largest number of rank 1 maximal parabolic subgroups
is called {\it maximally parabolic}. We show such groups exist. We state our
main theorems concisely here.
  Theorem I. The limit set of a maximally parabolic group is a circle packing;
that is, every component of its regular set is a round disc.
  Theorem II. A maximally parabolic group is geometrically finite.
  Theorem III. A maximally parabolic pinched function group is determined up to
conjugacy in $PSL(2,{\bf C})$ by its abstract isomorphism class and its
parabolic elements.
