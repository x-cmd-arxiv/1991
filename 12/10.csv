A7 (1992) 5337-5368","10.1142/S0217751X92002441",,"hep-th",,"  We propose a discrete model whose continuum limit reproduces the string
susceptibility and the scaling dimensions of $(2,4m)$-minimal superconformal
models coupled to $2D$-supergravity. The basic assumption in our presentation
is a set of super-Virasoro constraints imposed on the partition function. We
recover the Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sectors of the theory, and we are also
able to evaluate all planar loop correlation functions in the continuum limit.
We find evidence to identify the integrable hierarchy of non-linear equations
describing the double scaling limit as a supersymmetric generalization of KP
studied by Rabin.

gauge potential that is almost everywhere pure gauge. Solution of quantum
mechanical wave equations in the presence of such fields is therefore immediate
and leads to a new derivation of the quantum electrodynamical eikonal
approximation. The elctromagnetic action in the eikonal limit is localised on a
contour in a two-dimensional Minkowski subspace of four-dimensional space-time.
The exact S-matrix of this reduced theory coincides with the eikonal
approximation, and represents the generalisatin to electrodynamics of the
approach of 't Hooft and the Verlinde's to Planckian scattering.

full reducibility into semi-periodic representations. On the other hand,
heterogeneous $\cR$-matrices which intertwine tensor products of periodic or

given. These $\cR$-matrices satisfy all the possible Yang Baxter equations with

compatibility between these two kinds of representations has never been used in
