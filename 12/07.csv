criticality achieved by including background charges in the two real time
directions, exhibits a ``coordinate-freezing'' phenomenon, whereby the momentum
in one of the two time directions is constrained to take a specific value for
each physical state. This effectively removes this time direction as a physical
coordinate, leaving the theory with $(1,d-2)$ real spacetime signature. Norm
calculations for low-lying physical states suggest that the theory is ghost
free.

traditional superstrings and heterotic strings. They have critical spacetime
dimensions which are less than ten, and in this paper we investigate
model-building for the heterotic versions of these new theories. We concentrate
on the cases with critical spacetime dimensions four and six, and find that a
correspondence can be drawn between the new fractional superstring models and a
special subset of the traditional heterotic string models. This allows us to
generate the partition functions of the new models, and demonstrate that their
number is indeed relatively limited. It also appears that these strings have
uniquely natural compactifications to lower dimensions. In particular, the
fractional superstring with critical dimension six has a natural interpretation
in four-dimensional spacetime.
