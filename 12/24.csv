model, first derived by Witten. We generalize the method to a model of unitary
matrices, for which we find a new set of Virasoro constraints. Finally we
discuss the solution for symmetric matrices in an external field.

of curved string backgrounds that are independent of $d$ coordinates. The
explicit action of the symmetries on the backgrounds is described. Particular
attention is paid to the dilaton transformation. Such symmetries identify
different cosmological solutions and other (possibly) singular backgrounds; for
example, it is shown that a compact black string is dual to a charged black
hole. The extension to the heterotic string is discussed.

of Chern--Simons theory with gauge group SU(2). We also describe a new
invariant for certain class of graphs by interpreting the triangulation of a
manifold as a graph consisiting of crossings and vertices with three lines. We
further show, for $S^3$ and $RP^3$, that the Turaev-Viro invariant is the
square of the absolute value of their respective partition functions in SU(2)
Chern--Simons theory and give a method of evaluating the later in a closed form
for lens spaces $L_{p,1}$.

of Ponzano and Regge and establish its isomorphism to the ones in the $ISO(3)$
Chern-Simons theory. It is shown that, for a handlebody of any genus, a
Hartle-Hawking-type wave-function of the lattice gravity transforms into the
corresponding state in the Chern-Simons theory under this isomorphism. Using
the Heegaard splitting of a three-dimensional manifold, a partition function of
each of these theories is expressed as an inner product of such wave-functions.
Since the isomorphism preserves the inner products, the partition function of
the two theories are the same for any closed orientable manifold. We also
discuss on a class of topology-changing amplitudes in the lattice gravity and
their relation to the ones in the Chern-Simons theory.
