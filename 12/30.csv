though the solutions obtained with this method are not exact, they approximate
extremely well the true solutions, as we explicitly show using numerical
simulations. ``Physical'' solutions are seen to be separatrices corresponding
to degenerate Riemann surfaces. We obtain an analytic approximation in
excellent agreement with the numerical solution found by Parisi et al. for the
$k=3$ case.
