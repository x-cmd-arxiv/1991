author's famous series, ""The Art of Computer Programming"". He generalizes the
notion of a context-free language from a set to a multiset of words over an
alphabet. The idea is to keep track of the number of ways to parse a string.
For example, ""fruit flies like a banana"" can famously be parsed in two ways;
analogous examples in the setting of programming languages may yet be important
in the future.
  The treatment is informal but essentially rigorous.
