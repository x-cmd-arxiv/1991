which was presented at the 1991 joint Lepton--Photon and EPS Conference in
Geneva, and an Open Letter addressed to HEPAP. One is addressed primarily to
the European high--energy physics community, the other to the American. A
common theme of these presentations is a plea for the rational allocation of
the limited funds society provides for high--energy physics research. If my
`loose cannon' remarks may seem irresponsible to some of my colleagues, my
silence would be more so.

determine chiral rings which are exactly the fusion rings of Sp(N)_{K} WZW
models. The quasi-homogeneous part of the potential associated with Sp(N)_{K}
is the same as the quasi-homogeneous part of that associated with SU(N+1)_{K},
showing that these potentials are different perturbations of the same
Grassmannian potential. Twisted N=2 topological Landau-Ginzburg theories are
derived from these superpotentials. The correlation functions, which are just
the Sp(N)_{K} Verlinde dimensions, are expressed as fusion residues. We note
that the Sp(N)_{K} and Sp(K)_{N} topological Landau-Ginzburg theories are
identical, and that while the SU(N)_{K} and SU(K)_{N} topological
Landau-Ginzburg models are not, they are simply related.
