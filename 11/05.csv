scale properties of the Quantum Hall system can be successfully described by
effective field theories which use the Chern-Simons interaction. In this
article, we first recall certain salient features of the Quantum Hall Effect
and their microscopic explanation. We then review one particular approach to
their description based on the Chern-Simons Lagrangian and its variants.

conformal field theory description of the usual geometrical phase transitions
in two dimensions, like polymers, percolation or brownian motion. In
particular, four point functions of operators with half integer Kac labels are
computed, together with geometrical operator products. In addition to Ramond
and Neveu Schwartz, a sector with quarter twists has to be introduced. The role
of fermions and their various sectors is geometrically interpreted, modular
invariant partition functions are built. The presence of twisted N=2 is traced
back to the Parisi Sourlas supersymmetry. It is shown that N=2 leads also to
new non trivial predictions; for instance the fractal dimension of the
percolation backbone in two dimensions is conjectured to be D=25/16, in good
agreement with numerical studies.

limit belongs to the $N=2$ series. The first kind of model is integrable and
obtained through a geometrical reformulation, generalizing results known in the
$k=1$ case, of the $\Gamma_{k}$ vertex models (based on the quantum algebra
$U_{q}sl(2)$ and representation of spin $j=k/2$). We demonstrate in particular
that at the $N=2$ point, the free energy of the $\Gamma_{k}$ vertex model can
be obtained exactly by counting arguments, without any Bethe ansatz
computation, and we exhibit lattice operators that reproduce the chiral ring.
The second class of models is more adequately described in the language of
twisted $N=2$ supersymmetry, and consists of an infinite series of
multicritical polymer points, which should lead to experimental realizations.
It turns out that the exponents $\nu=(k+2)/2(k+1)$ for these multicritical
polymer points coincide with old phenomenological formulas due to the chemist
Flory. We therefore confirm that these formulas are {\bf exact} in two
dimensions, and suggest that their unexpected validity is due to non
renormalization theorems for the $N=2$ underlying theories. We also discuss the
status of the much discussed theta point for polymers in the light of $N=2$
renormalization group flows.

fermionic BRST operator of the first quantized theory and $A$ is the anti-
commuting connection for the gauge group. This equation can be derived as a
condition of the gauge independence of the first quantized theory in a
background field $A$, or from the string field theory Lagrangian of the Chern-
Simons type. The trivial solutions of the cohomology are the gauge symmetries,
