"hep-th/9111057",,"E. Abdalla, M.C.B. Abdalla, D. Dalmazi, Koji Harada","General Neveu-Schwarz Correlators in Super Liouville Theory","26 pages",,,,"hep-th",,"  In this paper we compute the N-point correlation functions of the tachyon
operator from the Neveu Schwarz sector of super Liouville theory coupled to
matter fields (with $\hat c\le 1$) in the super Coulomb gas formulation, on
world sheets with spherical topology. We first integrate over the zero mode
assuming that the $s$ parameter takes an integer value, subsequently we
continue the parameter to an arbitrary real number. We included an arbitrary
number of screening charges (s.c.) and as a result, after renormalizing the
s.c., the external legs and the cosmological constant, the form of the final
amplitudes do not modify. Remarkably, the result is completely parallel to the
bosonic case. We also completed a discussion on the calculation of bosonic
correlators including arbitrary screening charges.
