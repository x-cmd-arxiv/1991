two dimensional black holes and the s-wave sector of four dimensional black
holes, and the physical interest of the latter, particularly in the
magnetically charged case.

algebra of quantum observables of a particle moving on a circle.
Mathematically, it is the universal enveloping algebra of the Euclidean algebra
in two dimensions. Similarly, the super W_\infty algebra is found to be the
universal enveloping algebra of the super-Euclidean algebra in two dimensions.

"math/9201298","Peter Jones","Peter Jones","On removable sets for Sobolev spaces in the plane",,,,"Stony Brook IMS 1991/22","math.DS",,"  Let $K$ be a compact subset of $\bar{\bold C} ={\bold R}^2$ and let $K^c$
denote its complement. We say $K\in HR$, $K$ is holomorphically removable, if
whenever $F:\bar{\bold C} \to\bar{\bold C}$ is a homeomorphism and $F$ is
holomorphic off $K$, then $F$ is a M\""obius transformation. By composing with a
M\""obius transform, we may assume $F(\infty )=\infty$. The contribution of this
paper is to show that a large class of sets are $HR$. Our motivation for these
results is that these sets occur naturally (e.g. as certain Julia sets) in
dynamical systems, and the property of being $HR$ plays an important role in
the Douady-Hubbard description of their structure.
