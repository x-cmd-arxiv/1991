the magnetically charged Reissner-Nordstrom solution develops a classical
instability if the horizon is sufficiently small. This instability has
significant implications for the evolution of a magnetically charged black
hole. In particular, it leads to the possibility that such a hole could
evaporate completely, leaving in its place a nonsingular magnetic monopole.

the second Hamiltonian structure of the integrable hierarchy resulting from the
interchange of x and t in the l^{th} flow of the sl(N) KdV hierarchy. The W_4^3
algebra is derived explicitly along these lines, thus providing further support
for the conjecture. This algebra is found to be equivalent to that obtained by
the method of Hamiltonian reduction. Furthermore, its twisted version
reproduces the algebra associated to a certain non-principal embedding of sl(2)
into sl(4), or equivalently, the u(2) quasi-superconformal algebra. The general
aspects of the W_N^l algebras are also presented.

flat Minkowski space. We propose a generalization of this theorem for an
arbitrary geometry of the N=2 SUSY string theory taking advantage of the N=4
SCA generators present in this model. Physical states are found to be the
highest weight states of the N=4 SCA.
