"math/9201297","Christopher Gol\'e","Christopher Gol\'e","Periodic orbits for Hamiltonian systems in cotangent bundles",,,,"Stony Brook IMS 1991/21","math.DS",,"  We prove the existence of at least $cl(M)$ periodic orbits for certain time
dependant Hamiltonian systems on the cotangent bundle of an arbitrary compact
manifold $M$. These Hamiltonians are not necessarily convex but they satisfy a
certain boundary condition given by a Riemannian metric on $M$. We discretize
the variational problem by decomposing the time 1 map into a product of
``symplectic twist maps''. A second theorem deals with homotopically non
trivial orbits in manifolds of negative curvature.
