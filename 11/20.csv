  School on High Energy Physics and Cosmology, July-Aug. 1991",,,,"hep-th",,"  We briefly review some results in the theory of quantum $W_3$ gravity in the
chiral gauge. We compare them with similar results in the analogous but simpler
cases of $d=2$ induced gauge theories and $d=2$ induced gravity.

nonperturbative $c=1$ $S$-matrices. This allows us to investigate the
constraint of nonperturbative unitarity, which indeed rules out some theories.
Nevertheless, we show that there is an infinite parameter family of
nonperturbatively unitary $c=1$ $S$-matrices. We investigate the dependence of
the $S$-matrix on one of these nonperturbative parameters. In particular, we
study the analytic structure, background dependence, and high-energy behavior
of some nonperturbative $c=1$ $S$-matrices. The scattering amplitudes display
interesting resonant behavior both at high energies and in the complex energy
plane.

generated by non-Abelian Hamiltonians. We apply this result to the group of
dressing transformations in soliton theories; we find that the non-Abelian
Hamiltonian is just the monodromy matrix. This provides a new proof of their
Lie-Poisson property. We show that the dressing transformations are the
classical precursors of the non-local and quantum group symmetries of these
theories. We treat in detail the examples of the Toda field theories and the
Heisenberg model.
