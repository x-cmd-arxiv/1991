double-scaling continuum limits of all multimatrix models. The interpolating
partition function is always a KP $\tau $-function and always obeys ${\cal
L}_{-1}$-constraint and string equation. Therefore this model can be considered
as a natural unification of all models of 2d-gravity (string models) with
$c\leq 1.$

dimensional curved space-time are constructed as exact $N=1$ superconformal
theories. The tachyon is eliminated with a GSO projection. The theory is based
on the N=1 superconformal gauged WZW model for the anti-de Sitter coset
$SO(3,2)/SO(3,1)$ with integer central extension $k=5$. The model has dynamical
duality properties in its space-time metric that are similar to the large-small
($R\rightarrow 1/R$) duality of tori. To first order in a $1/k$ expansion we
give expressions for the metric, the dilaton, the Ricci tensor and their dual
generalizations. The curvature scalar has several singularities at various
locations in the 4-dimensional manifold. This provides a new singular solution
to Einstein's equations in the presence of matter in four dimensions. A
non-trivial path integral measure which we conjectured in previous work for
gauged WZW models is verified.

hole background. There are relevant operators among the tachyon and the higher
level vertex operators in the conformal field theory. Connection of this
instability with Hawking radiation is not obvious. The situation is somewhat
analogous to fields in the background of a negative mass Euclidean
Schwarzschild solution (in four dimensions). Speculation is made about decay of
the Minkowski black hole into finite temperature flat space.

"hep-th/9111042",,"Gerald Gilbert (umdhep.umd.edu)","""the Instability of String-Theoretic Black Holes""","8 pages",,,,"hep-th",,"  It is demonstrated that static, charged, spherically--symmetric black holes
in string theory are classically and catastrophically unstable to linearized
perturbations in four dimensions, and moreover that unstable modes appear for
arbitrarily small positive values of the charge. This catastrophic classical
instability dominates and is distinct from much smaller and less significant
effects such as possible quantum mechanical evaporation. The classical
instability of the string--theoretic black hole contrasts sharply with the
situation which obtains for the Reissner--Nordstr\""om black hole of general
relativity, which has been shown by Chandrasekhar to be perfectly stable to
linearized perturbations at the event horizon.

Introductions to Hopf algebras, Poisson structures and deformation quantization
are also provided. After having defined Poisson-Lie groups we study their
relation to Lie-bi algebras and the classical Yang-Baxter equation. Then we
explain in detail the concept of quantization for them. As an example the
quantization of $sl_2$ is explicitly carried out. Next we show how quantum
groups are related to the Yang-Baxter equation and how they can be used to
solve it. Using the quantum double construction we explicitly construct the
universal $R$-matrix for the quantum $sl_2$ algebra. In the last section we
deduce all finite dimensional irreducible representations for $q$ a root of
unity. We also give their tensor product decomposition (fusion rules) which is
relevant to conformal field theory.
