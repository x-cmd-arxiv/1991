closed and associative for all values of the central charge $c$, using the
Jacobi identity and show the agreement with the results studied previously.
Then we illustrate a realization of $c=\frac{5}{2}$ free fermion model, which
is $m \rightarrow \infty$ limit of unitary minimal series, $c ( WB_{2}
)=\frac{5}{2} (1-\frac{12}{ (m+3)(m+4) })$ based on the cosets $( \hat{B_{2}}
\oplus \hat{B_{2}}, \hat{B_{2} })$ at level $(1,m).$ We confirm by explicit
computations that the bosonic currents in the $ WB_{2}$ algebra are indeed
given by the Casimir operators of $\hat{B_{2}}$ .

introduce the notions of deformability, positive-definiteness, and reductivity
of a W-algebra. We show that one can associate a reductive finite Lie algebra
to each reductive W-algebra. The finite Lie algebra is also endowed with a
preferred $sl(2)$ subalgebra, which gives the conformal weights of the
W-algebra. We extend this to cover W-algebras containing both bosonic and
fermionic fields, and illustrate our ideas with the Poisson bracket algebras of
generalised Drinfeld-Sokolov Hamiltonian systems. We then discuss the
possibilities of classifying deformable W-algebras which fall outside this
class in the context of automorphisms of Lie algebras. In conclusion we list
the cases in which the W-algebra has no weight one fields, and further, those
in which it has only one weight two field.
