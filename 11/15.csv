probabilities between segments of the boundary of a compact two-dimensional
region at the percolation threshold. These probabilities are shown to be
invariant not only under changes of scale, but also under mappings of the
region which are conformal in the interior and continuous on the boundary. This
is a larger invariance than that expected for generic critical systems.
Specific predictions are presented for the crossing probability between
opposite sides of a rectangle, and are compared with recent numerical work. The
agreement is excellent.

Conformal Field Theories. After an exposition of their general properties, we
examine known results on the complete classification for low number of fields
($\leq 4$). We then turn our attention to FRA's generated polynomially by one
(real) fundamental field, for which a classification is known. Attempting to
generalize this result, we describe some connections between FRA's and Graph
Theory. The possibility to get new results on the subject following this
``graph'' approach is briefly discussed.

orbit method, we derive an action for one dimensional strings. It is shown that
on the simplest nontrivial orbit this gives the single scalar collective field
theory. On higher orbits one finds generalized KdV type field theories with
increasing number of components. Here the tachyon is coupled to higher tensor
fields.

linearised covariant equations for the spacetime fields by considering the most
general deformation of the energy-momentum tensor which describes $c=1$ matter
system coupled to 2-d gravity and by demanding that it respect conformal
invariance. We derive the gauge invariances of the theory, and so investigate
the classical phase space, defined as the space of all solutions to the
equations of motion modulo gauge transformations. We thus clarify the origins
of two classes of isolated states.
