that the space-time singularities of general relativity may be described by
topological field theories (TFTs). We also argue that in general TFT is a field
theory which decsribes singular configurations with a reduced holonomy in its
field space.

which are important for building super-$W_3$ string theories. We derive the
structure of the ghost vacuum for such theories, and use the result to
calculate the intercepts. These results determine the conditions for physical
states in the super-$W_3$ string theory.

behavior of random surfaces with extrinsic curvature rigidity $1/\a$. We
illustrate this by making a small $D$ expansion of rigid random surfaces, where
a non-trivial infra-red fixed point is shown to exist. We speculate on the
renormalization group flow diagram in the $(\a,D)$ plane. We argue that the
qualitative behavior of numerical simulations in $D=3, 4$ could be understood
on the basis of the phase diagram.
