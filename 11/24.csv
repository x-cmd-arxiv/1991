cohomology with vanishing ghost number. These states form a ring and all the
other states in the theory fall into modules of this ring. The relations in the
ring and in the modules have a physical interpretation. The existence of these
rings and modules leads to nontrivial constraints on the correlation functions
and goes a long way toward solving these theories in the continuum approach.
