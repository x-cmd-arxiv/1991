matter in two space-time dimensions is analyzed. The theory is shown to be
exactly solvable classically. Included among the exact classical solutions are
configurations describing the formation of a black hole by collapsing matter.
The problem of Hawking radiation and backreaction of the metric is analyzed to
leading order in a $1/N$ expansion, where $N$ is the number of matter fields.
The results suggest that the collapsing matter radiates away all of its energy
before an event horizon has a chance to form, and black holes thereby disappear
from the quantum mechanical spectrum. It is argued that the matter
asymptotically approaches a zero-energy ``bound state'' which can carry global
quantum numbers and that a unitary $S$-matrix including such states should
exist.

obtained from free field realizations, of $W$ infinity algebras ($W_{\infty}$,
$W_{1+\infty}$, $W_{\infty}^{1,1}$, $W_{\infty}^M$, $W_{1+\infty}^N$,
$W_{\infty}^{M,N}$) with central charges ($2$, $1$, $3$, $2M$, $N$, $2M+N$).
The characters of these representations are computed. We construct a new
extended superalgebra $W_{\infty}^{M,N}$, whose bosonic sector is
$W_{\infty}^M\oplus W_{1+\infty}^N$. Its representations obtained from a free
field realization with central charge $2M+N$, are classified into two classes:
continuous series and discrete series. For the former there exists a
supersymmetry, but for the latter a supersymmetry exists only for $M=N$.

intriguing description in terms of models of 2D self-avoiding walks in the

supersymmetric, may then be interpreted as the tricritical Theta point where
the polymer chain undergoes a collapse transition. As a consequence, a
universal value of the deconfinement temperature is predicted.

field theory to provide a field theoretic description of knots and links in
three dimensions. A systematic method has been developed to obtain the
link-invariants within this field theoretic framework. The monodromy properties
of the correlators of the associated Wess-Zumino SU(2)$_k$ conformal field
theory on a two-dimensional sphere prove to be useful tools. The method is
simple enough to yield a whole variety of new knot invariants of which the
Jones polynomials are the simplest example.
