particular supermatrix integration is reduced to an integration over the
eigenvalues and the resulting volume element is shown to be equivalent to a one
dimensional Coulomb gas of both positive and negative charges.It is shown
that,for polynomial potentials, after removing the instability due to the
annihilation of opposite charges, supermatrix models are indistinguishable from
ordinary matrix models, in agreement with a recent result by Alvarez-Gaume and
Manes. It is pointed out however that this may not be true for more general
potentials such as for instance the supersymmetric generalization of the Penner
model.
