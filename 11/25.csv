gravity is studied by means of the operator product expansion of vertex
operators after the Liouville zero mode integration. Short-distance
singularities between two tachyons with opposite chiralities account for all
singularities in the $N$-tachyon amplitudes. Although the factorization is
valid, other possible short-distance singularities corresponding to other
combinations of vertex operators are absent since the residue vanishes. Apart
from the tachyon states, there are infinitely many topological states
contributing to the intermediate states. This is a more detailed account of our
short communication on the factorization.

theories (TCFT). We showed that topological $SL(2)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW)
model, topological superconformal ghost system, TCFT constructed from the $N=2$
superconformal system and two dimensional topological gravity belong to the
same one parameter family (moduli space) of the $c=0$ TCFT's. We conjectured
that the $N=2$ TCFT constructed from the Wolf space realization of $N=4$
superconformal algebra belongs to another family.

  Decoupling Equations","17 pages",,,,"hep-th",,"  We use the Kontsevich--Miwa transform to relate the Virasoro constraints on
integrable hierarchies with the David-Distler-Kawai formalism of
gravity-coupled conformal theories. The derivation relies on evaluating the
energy-momentum tensor on the hierarchy at special values of the spectral
parameter. We thus obtain in the Kontsevich parametrization the `master
equations' which implement the Virasoro constraints and at the same time
coincide with null-vector decoupling equations in an `auxiliary' conformal
field theory on the complex plane of the spectral parameter. This gives the
operators their gravitational scaling dimensions (for one out of four
possibilities to choose signs), with the $\alpha_+$ being equal to the
background charge $Q$ of an abstract $bc$ system underlying the structure of
the Virasoro constraints. The formalism also generalizes to the $N$-KdV
hierarchies.
