the accompanying change in the geometry of the two dimensional target space is
determined. The possibility of this additional term arises from a symmetry in
the general formalism of gauging an isometry subgroup of a non-linear sigma
model with an antisymmetric tensor. It is shown, in particular, that the
space-time exhibits some general singularities for which the recently found
black hole is just a special case. From a conformal field theory point of view
and for special values of the unitary representations of $SL(2,R)$, this
topological term can be interpreted as a small perturbation by a (1,1)
conformal operator of the gauged WZWN action.
