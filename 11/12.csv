A7 (1992) 71-84","10.1142/S021773239200344X",,"hep-th",,"  We discuss the bosonization of non-relativistic fermions in one space
dimension in terms of bilocal operators which are naturally related to the
generators of $W$-infinity algebra. The resulting system is analogous to the
problem of a spin in a magnetic field for the group $W$-infinity. The new
dynamical variables turn out to be $W$-infinity group elements valued in the
coset $W$-infinity/$H$ where $H$ is a Cartan subalgebra. A classical action
with an $H$ gauge invariance is presented. This action is three-dimensional. It
turns out to be similiar to the action that describes the colour degrees of
freedom of a Yang-Mills particle in a fixed external field. We also discuss the
relation of this action with the one we recently arrived at in the Euclidean
continuation of the theory using different coordinates.

  Minimal CFTs","34 Pages",,,,"hep-th",,"  We construct the restricted sine-Gordon theory by truncating the sine-Gordon
multi-soliton Hilbert space for the repulsive coupling constant due to the
quantum group symmetry $SL_q(2)$ which we identify from the Korepin's
$S$-matrices. We connect this restricted sine-Gordon theory with the minimal
($c<1$) conformal field theory ${\cal M}_{p/p+2}$ ($p$ odd) perturbed by the
least relevent primary field $\Phi_{1,3}$. The exact $S$-matrices are derived
for the particle spectrum of a kink and neutral particles. As a consistency
check, we compute the central charge of the restricted theory in the UV limit
using the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz analysis and show that it is equal to that
of ${\cal M}_{p/p+2}$.

matter are investigated. We introduce the pseudo-null fields and the
generalized equations of motion, which are classified into series of the
Liouville charges. These series have something to do with the W and Virasoro
constraints. The pseudo-null fields have non-trivial contributions at the
boundaries of the moduli space. We explicitly evaluate the several boundary
contributions. Then the structures similar to the W and the Virasoro
constraints appearing in the topological and the matrix methods are realized.
Although our Ward identities have some different features from the other
methods, the solutions of the identities are consistent to the matrix model
results.
