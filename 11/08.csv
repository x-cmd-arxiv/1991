supersymmetric sigma models can be computed exactly as one varies the Kahler
structure. For the case of $CP^n$ these are related to special solutions of
affine toda equations. This allows us to extract exact results (including exact
instanton corrections). We find that the ground state metric is non-singular as
the size of the manifold shrinks to zero thus suggesting that 2d QFT makes
sense even beyond zero radius. In other words it seems that manifolds with zero
size are non-singular as target spaces for string theory (even when they are
not conformal). The cases of $CP^1$ and $CP^2$ are discussed in more detail.

"hep-th/9111017",,"C. Vafa","Topological Mirrors and Quantum Rings","24 p",,,,"hep-th",,"  Aspects of duality and mirror symmetry in string theory are discussed. We
emphasize, through examples, the importance of loop spaces for a deeper
understanding of the geometrical origin of dualities in string theory. Moreover
we show that mirror symmetry can be reformulated in very simple terms as the
statement of equivalence of two classes of topological theories: Topological
sigma models and topological Landau-Ginzburg models. Some suggestions are made
for generalization of the notion of mirror symmetry.
