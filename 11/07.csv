$N$=2 supersymmetric models. We obtain the soliton S-matrix for the minimal,
$N$=2 supersymmetric theory perturbed in the least relevant chiral primary
field, the $\Phi _{(1,3)}$ superfield. The perturbed theory has a nice
Landau-Ginzburg description with a Chebyshev polynomial superpotential. We show
that the S-matrix is a tensor product of an associated ordinary $ADE$ minimal
model S-matrix with a supersymmetric part. We calculate the ground-state energy
in these theories and in the analogous $N$=1 case and $SU(2)$ coset models. In
all cases, the ultraviolet limit is in agreement with the conformal field
theory.

Wess-Zumino model. From the explicit calculation of a finite, renormalized
effective action, the $\beta$-function is computed to three loops and is found
to agree with previous existing results. As a further, nontrivial check of the
method, the Callan-Symanzik equations are also verified to that loop order.
Finally, we argue that differential renormalization presents advantages over
other superspace renormalization methods, in that it avoids both the
ambiguities inherent to supersymmetric regularization by dimensional reduction
(SRDR), and the complications of virtually all other supersymmetric regulators.
