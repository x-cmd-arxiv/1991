massive quantum field theories. We discuss how these symmetries can be used to
exactly solve the integrable models. A possible way for generalizing to three
dimensions is shortly described.

conformal field theories, which includes the standard rational conformal field
theories as a small subspace. In a detailed example, we apply the general
theory to characterize and study the Lie h-invariant graphs, which classify the
Lie h-invariant conformal field theories of the diagonal ansatz on SO(n). The
Lie characterization of these graphs is another aspect of the recently observed
Lie group-theoretic structure of graph theory.

representations of Kac-Moody algebras at fractional level, with an emphasis on
the question of field identification. Generic classes of field identifications
are obtained from the analysis of the modular S matrix. These include the usual
class related to outer automorphisms, as well as some intrinsically nonunitary
field identifications. They allow for a simple choice of coset field
representatives where all field components of the coset are associated with
integrable finite weights.
