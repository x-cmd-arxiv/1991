two parameter deformation of the SU(1/1) superalgebra. One is led to an
extension of the braid group and the Hecke algebra which reduce to the known
ones when the two parameter coincide. The physical significance of the two
parameters is discussed.

  Yang-Mills in (2,2) spacetime","20 pages","Nucl.Phys. B376 (1992) 279-296","10.1016/0550-3213(92)90126-V",,"hep-th",,"  Ooguri and Vafa have shown that the open N=2 string corresponds to self-dual
Yang-Mills (SDYM) and also that, in perturbation theory, it has has a vanishing
four particle scattering amplitude. We discuss how the dynamics of the three
particle scattering implies that on shell states can only scatter if their
momenta lie in the same self-dual plane and then investigate classical SDYM
with the aim of comparing exact solutions with the tree level perturbation
theory predictions. In particular for the gauge group SL(2,C) with a plane wave
Hirota ansatz SDYM reduces to a complicated set of algebraic relations due to
de Vega. Here we solve these conditions and the solutions are shown to
correspond to collisions of plane wave kinks. The main result is that for a
class of kinks the resulting phase shifts are non-zero, the solution as a whole
is not pure gauge and so the scattering seems non-trivial. However the stress
energy and Lagrangian density are confined to string like regions in the space
time and in particular are zero for the incoming/outgoing kinks so the solution
does not correspond to physical four point scattering.

"hep-th/9110076",,"Krzysztof Gawedzki","Non-Compact WZW Conformal Field Theories",,,,,"hep-th",,"  We discuss non-compact WZW sigma models, especially the ones with symmetric
space $H^{\bf C}/H$ as the target, for $H$ a compact Lie group. They offer
examples of non-rational conformal field theories. We remind their relation to
the compact WZW models but stress their distinctive features like the
continuous spectrum of conformal weights, diverging partition functions and the
presence of two types of operators analogous to the local and non-local
insertions recently discussed in the Liouville theory. Gauging non-compact
abelian subgroups of $H^{\bf C}$ leads to non-rational coset theories. In
particular, gauging one-parameter boosts in the $SL(2,\bC)/SU(2)$ model gives
an alternative, explicitly stable construction of a conformal sigma model with
the euclidean 2D black hole target. We compute the (regularized) toroidal
partition function and discuss the spectrum of the theory. A comparison is made
with more standard approach based on the $U(1)$ coset of the $SU(1,1)$ WZW
theory where stability is not evident but where unitarity becomes more
transparent.
