model. We study a two dimensional field theory which can be obtained by
analytically continuing some of the variables in the SL(2,R) gauged WZW model.
We can derive Liouville theory from the analytically continued model, ( which
is a gauged SL(2,C)/SU(2) model, ) in a similar but more rigorous way than from
the original gauged WZW model. We investigate the observables of this gauged
SL(2,C)/SU(2) model. We find infinitely many extra observables which can not be
identified with operators in Liouville theory. We concentrate on observables
which are $(1,1)$ forms and the correlators of their integrals over two
dimensional spacetime. At a special value of the coupling constant of our
model, the correlators of these integrals on the sphere coincide with the
results from matrix models.

nonabelian Chern-Simons actions using well known ideas in gauge theories and
quantum gravity. Our approach does not involve choice of gauge or clever
manipulations of functional integrals. When the spatial slice is a disc, it
yields Witten's edge states carrying a representation of the Kac-Moody algebra.
The canonical expression for the generators of diffeomorphisms on the boundary
of the disc are also found, and it is established that they are the
Chern-Simons version of the Sugawara construction. This paper is a prelude to
our future publications on edge states, sources, vertex operators, and their
spin and statistics in 3D and 4D topological field theories.
