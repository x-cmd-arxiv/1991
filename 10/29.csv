theory point of view. The vacuum expectation value of the unknot is computed up
to order $g^6$ and it is shown that agreement with the exact result by Witten
implies no quantum correction at two loops for the two-point function. In
addition, it is shown from a perturbation theory point of view that the framing
dependence of the vacuum expectation value of an arbitrary knot factorizes in
the form predicted by Witten.
