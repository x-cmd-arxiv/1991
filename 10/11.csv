which is associated with the non-relativistic fermions. We give the
bosonization rule which defines the natural higher coordinates system to
describe the W-geometry. Generators of the W-algebra can be obtained from a
single tau-function by using vertex operators.

extrinsic geometry of the embedding of two-dimensional manifolds with chiral
parametrisation (W-surfaces) into higher dimensional K\""ahler manifolds. We
study the local and the global geometries of such embeddings, and connect them
to Toda equations. The additional variables of the related KP hierarchy are
shown to yield a specific coordinate system of the target-manifold, and this
allows us to prove that W-transformations are simply particular diffeomorphisms
of this target space. The W-surfaces are shown to be instantons of the
corresponding non-linear $\sigma$-models.

weak-star convergence to 0, and obtain an extension of the Josefson-Nissenzweig
theorem. This result is applied to embed analytic disks in the fiber over 0 of
the spectrum of H^infinity (B), the algebra of bounded analytic functions on
the unit ball B of an arbitrary infinite dimensional Banach space. Various
other embedding theorems are obtained. For instance, if the Banach space is
superreflexive, then the unit ball of a Hilbert space of uncountable dimension
can be embedded analytically in the fiber over 0 via an embedding which is
uniformly bicontinuous with respect to the Gleason metric.
