quantum groups. We find in Sklyanin's two parameter elliptic quantum algebra
and its generalizations, the conceptual basis for the Macdonald polynomials,
which ``interpolate'' between the zonal spherical functions of related real and
$p$\--adic symmetric spaces. The elliptic quantum algebras underlie the
$Z_n$\--Baxter models. We show that in the $n \air \infty$ limit, the Jost
function for the scattering of {\em first} level excitations in the
$Z_n$\--Baxter model coincides with the Harish\--Chandra\--like $c$\--function
constructed from the Macdonald polynomials associated to the root system $A_1$.
The partition function of the $Z_2$\--Baxter model itself is also expressed in
terms of this Macdonald\--Harish\--Chandra\ $c$\--function, albeit in a less
simple way. We relate the two parameters $q$ and $t$ of the Macdonald
polynomials to the anisotropy and modular parameters of the Baxter model. In
particular the $p$\--adic ``regimes'' in the Macdonald polynomials correspond
to a discrete sequence of XXZ models. We also discuss the possibility of
``$q$\--deforming'' Euler products.

string theory, constructed as twisted products of one Euclidean and one
Minkowskian 2D black hole coset. One class of these solutions leads (after
tensoring with free scalars and supersymmetrizing) to a rotating version of the
recently discovered exact black fivebrane. Another class represents a
one-parameter family of axisymmetric stationary four-dimensional targets with
horizons. Global properties and target duality of the 4D solutions are briefly
analyzed.
