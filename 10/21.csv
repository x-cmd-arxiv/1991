  Geometric Methods in Physics, New York, June 1991",,,,"hep-th math.DG math.QA",,"  We study the perturbation theory for three dimensional Chern--Simons quantum
field theory on a general compact three manifold without boundary. We show that
after a simple change of variables, the action obtained by BRS gauge fixing in
the Lorentz gauge has a superspace formulation. The basic properties of the
propagator and the Feynman rules are written in a precise manner in the
language of differential forms. Using the explicit description of the
propagator singularities, we prove that the theory is finite. Finally the
anomalous metric dependence of the $2$-loop partition function on the
Riemannian metric (which was introduced to define the gauge fixing) can be
cancelled by a local counterterm as in the $1$-loop case. In fact, the
counterterm is equal to the Chern--Simons action of the metric connection,
normalized precisely as one would expect based on the framing dependence of
Witten's exact solution.

gravity model. We show that in the semiclassical continuum limit the
Turaev-Viro invariant obtained recently defines naturally regularized
path-integral $\grave{\rm a}$ la Ponzano-Regge, In which a contribution from
the cosmological term is effectively included. The regularization dependent
cosmological constant is found to be ${4\pi^2\over k^2} +O(k^{-4})$, where
$q^{2k}=1$. We also discuss the relation to the Euclidean Chern-Simons-Witten
gravity in 3-dimension.

ADE series of purely elastic S-matrices are rederived in a universal way. In
particular, the relationship between the pole structure and the bootstrap
equations is shown to follow from properties of root systems. The discussion
leads to a formula for the signs of the three-point couplings in the
simply-laced affine Toda theories, and a simple proof of a result due to
Klassen and Melzer of relevance to Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz calculations.

using the Batalin-Vilkovisky method. We show the full structure of the master
action. By imposing gauge conditions on the gauge fields rather than on
coordinates we find a gauge-fixed quantum action which is free. The structure
of the BRST charge is exhibited and the BRST cohomology yields the same
physical spectrum as the light- cone quantization of the usual superparticle.

constructions in the most general case, i.e. when orbifold deformations are
considered. This includes a certain number of tasks. Namely, determination of
the allowed couplings, calculation of the explicit dependence of the Yukawa
couplings values on the moduli expectation values (i.e. the parameters
determining the size and shape of the compactified space), etc. The final
expressions are completely explicit, which allows a counting of the DIFFERENT
Yukawa couplings for each orbifold (with and without deformations). This
knowledge is crucial to determine the phenomenological viability of the
different schemes, since it is directly related to the fermion mass hierarchy.
Other facts concerning the phenomenological profile of Z_n orbifolds are also
discussed, e.g. the existence of non--diagonal entries in the fermion mass
matrices, which is related to a non--trivial structure of the
Kobayashi--Maskawa matrix. Finally some theoretical results are given, e.g. the
no--participation of (1,2) moduli in twisted Yukawa couplings. Likewise, (1,1)
moduli associated with fixed tori which are involved in the Yukawa coupling, do
not affect the value of the coupling.
