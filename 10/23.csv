form $a U + b U^2 + h.c.$ is integrable. By reduction to the dynamics of the
eigenvalues, we establish the integrability of a system of particles in one
space dimension in an external potential of the form $a \cos (x+\alpha ) + b
\cos ( 2x +\beta )$ and interacting through two-body potentials of the inverse
sine square type. This system constitutes a generalization of the Sutherland
model in the presence of external potentials. The positive-definite matrix
model, obtained by analytic continuation, is also integrable, which leads to
the integrability of a system of particles in hyperbolic potentials interacting
through two-body potentials of the inverse hypebolic sine square type.
