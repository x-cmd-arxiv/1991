background. Especially, the structure of the duality in the target space is
discussed. The duality is analogous to \lq\lq $R \rightarrow 1/R$"" symmetry of
a compactified boson. We consider the duality in more general target space
manifolds which have Killing symmetries and we give an explicit formula which
connects two different manifolds which are dual to each other. Superstring
theory in two dimensional black hole background is also discussed based on
supersymmetric $SU(1,1)/U(1)$ gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model.

field and periodic potential has delocalization critical points which
correspond to backgrounds for the open string. We study the phase diagram of
this system (in the magnetic field/dissipation constant plane) and find a
fractal structure which, in the limit of zero dissipation, matches the fractal
energy level structure of the pure quantum mechanical version of this problem
(Hofstadter model).

perturbation theory we argue that the $\phi_{1,3}$-perturbation of a unitary
minimal $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) in the $D$-series of
modular invariant partition functions induces a renormalization group (RG) flow
to the next-lower model in the $D$-series. An exception is the first model in
the series, the 3-state Potts CFT, which under the $\ZZ_2$-even
$\phi_{1,3}$-perturbation flows to the tricritical Ising CFT, the second model
in the $A$-series. We present arguments that in the $A$-series flow
corresponding to this exceptional case, interpolating between the tetracritical
and the tricritical Ising CFT, the IR fixed point is approached from ``exactly
the opposite direction''. Our results indicate how (most of) the relevant
conformal fields evolve from the UV to the IR CFT.

naturally leads to the consideration of Witten's topological non-linear
sigma-model and the structure of rational curves on the Calabi-Yau manifold. We
study in detail the case of the world-sheet of the string being mapped to a
multiple cover of an isolated rational curve and we show that a natural
compactification of the moduli space of such a multiple cover leads to a
formula in agreement with a conjecture by Candelas, de la Ossa, Green and
Parkes.
