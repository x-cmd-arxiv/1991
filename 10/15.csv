  Workshop on Current Problems in Particle Theory, Johns Hopkins University,
  August 26--28, 1991",,,,"hep-th",,"  We present an account of the early developments that led to the present form
of the flipped $SU(5)$ string model. We focus on the method used to decide on
this particular string model, as well as the basic steps followed in
constructing generic models in the free fermionic formulation of superstrings
in general and flipped $SU(5)$ in particular. We then describe the basic
calculable features of the model which are used to obtain its low-energy
spectrum: doublet and triplet Higgs mass matrices, fermion Yukawa matrices,
neutrino masses, and the top-quark mass. We also review the status of proton
decay in the model, as well as the hidden sector bound states called cryptons.
Finally, we comment on the subject of string threshold corrections and string
unification.

theory is shown to correspond to a general off-shell field configuration in low
energy effective field theory. A set of string field theoretic symmetries that
act on the fields in low energy effective field theory as general coordinate
transformation and antisymmetric tensor gauge transformation is identified. The
analysis is carried out to first order in the fields; thus the symmetry
transformations in string field theory reproduce the linear and the first
non-linear terms in the gauge transformations in the low energy effective field
theory.

model and an arbitrary unitary conformal fild theory. We show that the
solutions of the Virasoro conditions, in the unitarity regime of the SU(1,1)
theory, are states which lie in the Euclidean coset SU(1,1)/U(1). This shows
the validity, at the quantum level, of a time-like type of gauge in these
models.
