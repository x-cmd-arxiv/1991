models which have quantum algebra symmetry. Here we summarize this work, and
also present new results on graded models, and on the so-called string
solutions of the Bethe Ansatz equations for the $A^{(2)}_2$ model.

have quantum-algebra symmetry and which are integrable. We show here that these
models can be exactly solved using a generalization of the analytical Bethe
Ansatz (BA) method. In particular, we determine in this way the spectrum of the
transfer matrices of the $U_q [(su(2)]$-invariant spin chains associated with
$A^{(1)}_1$ and $A^{(2)}_2$ in the fundamental representation. The
quantum-algebra invariance of these models plays an essential role in obtaining
these results. The BA equations for these open chains are ``doubled'' with
respect to the BA equations for the corresponding closed chains.

stochastic regularization of the unstable matrix model showing, first, that the

scaled potential exhibits an instanton--like behaviour, which is universal and
scales, but whose interpretation in terms of pure gravity is still open.

show that associativity and closure of these algebras determines their

precisely one current. We compute the structure constants of these algebras
explicitly and we show that correlators of the currents satisfy non-Abelian
braiding relations.

models can be represented as quotients of a self-dual sigma model obtained by
gauging different combinations of chiral currents. This observation is used to
clarify the interpretation of the generalized duality as a symmetry of
conformal field theory. We extend these results to $N=2$ supersymmetric sigma
models.
