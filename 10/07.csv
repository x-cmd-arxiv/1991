quantum gravity, at center of mass energies comparable or larger than the
Planck energy. We show that quantum gravitational effects in this kinematical
regime are described by means of a topological field theory. We find that the
scattering amplitudes display a universal behaviour very similar to two
dimensional string amplitudes, thereby recovering results obtained previously
by 't Hooft. Finally, we discuss the two-particle process in some detail.

gravity is considered. It corresponds to the ISO(2,1) Chern-Simons theory, in
which the torsion source is restricted to its intrinsic spin part. A class of
explicit solutions is found for the dreibein and the spin connection, which are
torsionless in the spinless limit. By using the residual local Poincare'
invariance of the solutions, we fix the gauge so that the metric is smooth
outside the particles and satisfies proper asymptotic conditions at space and
time infinity. We recover previous results for test bodies and find new ones
for the scattering of two dynamical particles in the massless limit.

regular isotopy invariant of links and tangled graphs. We show that the
invariant equals the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant corresponding to the
exceptional simple Lie algebra G_2. It is therefore related to G_2 in the same
way that the HOMFLY polynomial is related to A_n and the Kauffman polynomial is
related to B_n, C_n, and D_n. We give parallel constructions for the other rank
2 Lie algebras and present some combinatorial conjectures motivated by the new
inductive definitions.
