numbers of quarks. They exist only for quarks heavier than the dimensional
gauge coupling, and have infinite energy, corresponding to the presence of a
string carrying the non-singlet color flux off to spatial infinity. The quark
solitons also disappear at finite temperature, as the temperature-dependent
effective quark mass is reduced in the approach to the quark/hadron phase
transition.

constant, are investigated. Soliton solutions are found, which, despite the
non-unitary form of the Lagrangian, have real classical masses and are stable
to small perturbations. The quantum corrections to the soliton masses are
determined, to lowest order in $\hbar$. The solitons have the same spectrum as
the fundamental Toda particles; a feature that is preserved in the quantum
theory.
