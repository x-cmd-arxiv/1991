crystallographic concept of Bravais class to quasiperiodic materials. Such
pitfalls can be avoided by abandoning the obsolete paradigm that bases ordinary
crystallography on microscopic periodicity. The broadening of crystallography
to include quasiperiodic materials is accomplished by defining the point group
in terms of indistinguishable (as opposed to identical) densities.

Kac-Moody algebras and the free field representation of the corresponding WZW
models. After imposing suitable constraints, we can lead the Feigin-Fuchs
representation of Virasoro algebras and coadjoint actions ofthe N=1 and N=2
conformal symmetries. This formulation corresponds to a supercovariant
extension of the Drinfeld and Sokolov Hamiltonian reduction.
