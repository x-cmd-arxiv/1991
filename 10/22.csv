surfaces. Semirigid surfaces occur naturally in the description of topological
gravity as well as topological supergravity. We show that such surfaces are
obtained by an integrable reduction of the structure group of a complex
supermanifold. We also discuss the \s moduli spaces of $TN$-\SR\ surfaces and
their relation to the moduli spaces of $N$-\s\ \RS s.

conformal field theory G_k is isomorphic to P(u)/(\del V), where V is a
polynomial in u and (\del V) is the ideal generated by the conditions \del V=0.
We also derive a residue-like formula for the correlation functions in the
Chern-Simons theory thus providing a RCFT version of the residue formula for
the TLG models. An operator that acts like the measure in the residue formula
has the ionterpretation of a handle squashing operator and an explicit formula
for this operator is given.
