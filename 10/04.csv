General Relativity, Kyoto, Japan in June 1991. Some developments in string
theory over the last six years are discussed together with their qualitative
implications for issues in quantum gravity.

$\hat c \leq 1$ superconformal matter in the conformal gauge. The
super-Liouville and superconformal matters are represented by free scalar
fields $\phi^L$ and $\phi^M$ and fermions $\psi^L$ and $\psi^M$, respectively,
with suitable background charges, and these are coupled in such a way that the
BRST charge is nilpotent. The physical states of the full theory are determined
for NS and R sectors. It is shown that there are extra states with ghost number
$N_{FP}=0,\pm 1$ for discrete momenta other than the degree of freedom
corresponding to the ``center of mass"", and that these are closely related to
the ``null states"" in the minimal models with $\hat c<1$.

"hep-th/9110014",,"B.R. Greene and M.R. Plesser","Mirror Manifolds: A Brief Review and Progress Report","19 pages",,,,"hep-th",,"  We first give a complete, albeit brief, review of the discovery of mirror
symmetry in $N=2$ string/conformal field theory. In particular, we describe the
naturality arguments which led to the initial mirror symmetry conjectures and
the subsequent work which established the existence of mirror symmetry through
direct construction. We then review a number of striking consequences of mirror
symmetry -- both conceptual and calculational. Finally, we describe recent work
which introduces a variant on our original proof of the existence of mirror
symmetry. This work affirms classical--quantum symmetry duality as well as
extends the domain of our initial mirror symmetry construction.
