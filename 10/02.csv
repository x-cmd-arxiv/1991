$d$ (out of $D$) space-time coordinates has been recently identified. Here we
write down, for $d=D-1$, the low energy equations of motion and their general
solution in a manifestly $O(d,d)$-invariant form, pointing out an amusing
similarity with the renormalization group framework. Previously considered
cosmological and black hole solutions are recovered as particular examples.

conformal theory has Landau-Ginzburg model $W=-\qa (x^4 +y^4)+\af x^2y^2$.
While consistency conditions are used to solve it, this model is probably at
the limit of such techniques. By using the flatness of the metric of the space
of coupling constants I rederive the differential equation that relates the
parameter \af\ to the flat coordinate $t$. This simpler method is also applied
to the $x^3+y^6$-model.

conformal field theories. Specifically, we discuss the construction of free
field resolutions for the integrable highest weight modules of untwisted affine
Kac-Moody algebras, and extend the construction to a certain class of
admissible highest weight modules. Using these, we construct resolutions of the
completely degenerate highest weight modules of W-algebras by means of the
quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction. As a corollary we derive character formulae
for these degenerate highest weight modules.
