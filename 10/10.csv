spaces of the generalised $Sl(2)$ and $Sl(3)$ KdV hierachies. This involves the
construction of two group actions in terms of Yang Baxter operators, and an
Hamiltonian reduction of the coadjoint orbits. The Poisson brackets are
reproduced by the Kirillov construction. From this construction we obtain a
`natural' gauge fixing proceedure for the generalised hierarchies.

theory amplitudes, in particular those defined on surfaces with boundaries, to
explore effective string theory amplitudes for some hadronic processes. Two
examples are considered to illustrate the approach. In one a natural mechanism
for chiral symmetry breaking within the string picture is proposed. One
consequence is that the vertex operator for pion emission (at zero momentum)
behaves like a world sheet current evaluated on the string boundary. This fact
is used to rederive, in a more general setting, hadronic mass relations found
in the early days of string theory by Lovelace, and Ademollo, Veneziano and
Weinberg. In the second example, we derive the general structure of the form
factor for the emission of a pomeron (interpreted as a closed string) from a
meson or baryon. The result reconciles the interpretation of the pomeron as a
closed string, emitted from the interior of the meson or baryon world sheet,
with the additive quark rules for total hadronic cross sections. We also review
the difficulties involved in constructing complete effective string theories
for hadrons, and comment on the relation between the intercepts of trajectories
and the short distance behavior of the underlying theory.
