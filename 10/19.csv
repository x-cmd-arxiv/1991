taking different embeddings of the gauge group $H\subset G$ as it acts on the
left and right of the group element $g$. This leads to models that are dual to
each other, generalizing the axial/vector duality of the two dimensional black
hole manifold. The classical equations are completely solved for any pair
$(G,H)$ and in particular for the anti de Sitter string based on $SO(d-
1,2)/SO(d-1,1)$ for which the normal modes are determined. Duality is
demonstrated for models that have the same set of normal modes. Concentrating
on $SO(2,2)/SO(2,1)$, the metric and dilaton fields of the $d=3$ string as well
as some of the dual generalizations are obtained. They have curvature
singularities and represent new singular solutions of Einstein's general
relativity in three dimensions.

matter models that are obtained by perturbing the twisted $N=2$ supersymmetric,
hermitian symmetric, coset models. In particular, this leads to an embedding of
the fusion ring of $G$ as a sub-ring of the perturbed, chiral primary ring. The
perturbation of the twisted $N=2$ model that leads to the fusion ring is also
shown to lead to an integrable $N=2$ supersymmetric field theory when the
untwisted $N=2$ superconformal field theory is perturbed by the same operator
and its hermitian conjugate.
