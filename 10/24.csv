spacetime duality interchanges the momentum in the symmetry direction and the
axion charge per unit length. As one application, we show explicitly that
charged black strings are equivalent to boosted (uncharged) black strings. The
extremal black strings (which correspond to the field outside of a fundamental
macroscopic string) are equivalent to plane fronted waves describing strings
moving at the speed of light.
