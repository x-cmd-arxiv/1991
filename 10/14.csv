$W$-gravity theories. In particular, we discuss the construction of
anomaly-free $W_\infty$ and $W_3$ gravities.

solvable; the solution exhibits some unusual features, and is qualitatively
different from the closed case. The open string ``tachyon'' S -- matrix
describes free fermions, which can be interpreted as the quarks at the ends of
the string. These ``quarks'' live naturally on a lattice in space-time. We also
find an exact vacuum solution of the theory, corresponding to a charged black
hole.

supersymmetric WZW model in terms of $N=2$ chiral and twisted chiral
multiplets. We discuss the $N=4$ supersymmetry of this model and exhibit the
$N=4$ superconformal current algebra. Finally, we show that the off-shell
formulation makes it possible to perform a duality transformation, which leads
to a supersymmetric sigma model on a manifold with a black hole type
singularity.
