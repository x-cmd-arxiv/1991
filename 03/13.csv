covering structure of a polynomial of degree $d$ with a path-lifting algorithm
for finding individual roots. In particular, the family includes an algorithm
that computes an $\epsilon$-factorization of the polynomial which has an
arithmetic complexity of $\Order{d^2(\log d)^2 + d(\log d)^2|\log\epsilon|}$.
At the present time (1993), this complexity is the best known in terms of the
degree.
