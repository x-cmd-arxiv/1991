superstring using a BRST operator with a nonminimal term, which allows all
bosonic ghost modes to be paired into creation and annihilation operators.
Vertex operators for the Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sectors have the same ghost
number, as do string fields. The kinetic and interaction terms are the same for
Neveu-Schwarz as for Ramond string fields, so spacetime supersymmetry is closer
to being manifest. The kinetic terms and supersymmetry don't mix levels,
simplifying component analysis and gauge fixing.

"hep-th/9108022","John Schwarz","John H. Schwarz","Superstring Compactification and Target Space Duality","21 pages",,,,"hep-th",,"  This review talk focusses on some of the interesting developments in the area
of superstring compactification that have occurred in the last couple of years.
These include the discovery that ``mirror symmetric"" pairs of Calabi--Yau
spaces, with completely distinct geometries and topologies, correspond to a
single (2,2) conformal field theory. Also, the concept of target-space duality,
originally discovered for toroidal compactification, is being extended to
Calabi--Yau spaces. It also associates sets of geometrically distinct manifolds
to a single conformal field theory.
  A couple of other topics are presented very briefly. One concerns conceptual
challenges in reconciling gravity and quantum mechanics. It is suggested that
certain ``distasteful allegations"" associated with quantum gravity such as loss
of quantum coherence, unpredictability of fundamental parameters of particle
physics, and paradoxical features of black holes are likely to be circumvented
by string theory. Finally there is a brief discussion of the importance of
supersymmetry at the TeV scale, both from a practical point of view and as a
potentially significant prediction of string theory.

interpolate between two degenerate asymmetric vacua. As a consequence of the
different structure of the two vacua, the crossing symmetry is implemented in a
non-trivial way. We use finite-size techniques to compare our results with the
numerical data obtained by the Truncated Conformal Space Approach and find good
agreement.
