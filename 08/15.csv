charged black strings in three dimensions. Unlike previous charged black hole
or extended black hole solutions in string theory, the low energy spacetime
metric has a regular inner horizon (in addition to the event horizon) and a
timelike singularity. As the charge to mass ratio approaches unity, the event
horizon remains but the singularity disappears.
