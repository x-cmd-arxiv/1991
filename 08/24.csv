dodecahedral lattice is shown to correspond to a model of oriented
self-avoiding surfaces. Using large $N$ reduction it is argued that the model
is partially soluble in the planar limit.

Quantum Gravity, Barcelona 10-14 June 1991. It is an updated review of recent
work done by the authors on a proposal for non-perturbatively stable 2D quantum
gravity coupled to c<1 matter, based on the flows of the (generalised) KdV
hierarchy.
