theory can be expressed as correlation functions in a topological LG theory. It
is seen that a necessary condition is that the RCFT fusion rules must exhibit
an extra symmetry. We consider two particular perturbations of the Grassmannian
superpotentials. The topological LG residues in one perturbation, introduced by
Gepner, are shown to be a twisted version of the $SU(N)_k$ Verlinde dimensions.
The residues in the other perturbation are the twisted Verlinde dimensions of
another RCFT; these topological LG correlation functions are conjectured to be
the correlation functions of the corresponding Grassmannian topological sigma
model with a coupling in the action to instanton number.
