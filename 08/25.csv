coupled to super Coulomb gas on world sheets with spherical topology. We first
integrate over the zero mode and assume that a parameter takes an integer
value. After calculating the amplitudes, we formally continue the parameter to
an arbitrary real number. Remarkably the result is completely parallel to the
bosonic case, the amplitudes being of the same form as those of the bosonic
case.
