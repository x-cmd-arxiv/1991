dimensions, and knowledge of its on-shell quantum group symmetries, we describe
how to extend the symmetry to the space of fields. This is accomplished by
introducing an adjoint action of the symmetry generators on fields, and
specifying the form factors of descendents. The braiding relations of quantum
field multiplets is shown to be given by the universal $\CR$-matrix. We develop
in some detail the case of infinite dimensional Yangian symmetry. We show that
the quantum double of the Yangian is a Hopf algebra deformation of a level zero
Kac-Moody algebra that preserves its finite dimensional Lie subalgebra. The
fields form infinite dimensional Verma-module representations; in particular
the energy-momentum tensor and isotopic current are in the same multiplet.

"hep-th/9108008",,"J. Sonnenschein and S. Yankielowicz","Novel Symmetries of Topological Conformal Field theories","26 pages",,,,"hep-th",,"  We show that various actions of topological conformal theories that were
suggested recentely are particular cases of a general action. We prove the
invariance of these models under transformations generated by nilpotent
fermionic generators of arbitrary conformal dimension, $\Q$ and $\G$. The later
are shown to be the $n^{th}$ covariant derivative with respect to ``flat
abelian gauge field"" of the fermionic fields of those models. We derive the
bosonic counterparts $\W$ and $\R$ which together with $\Q$ and $\G$ form a
special $N=2$ super $W_\infty$ algebra. The algebraic structure is discussed
and it is shown that it generalizes the so called ``topological algebra"".

  Theory","25 pages","Nucl.Phys. B372 (1992) 270-292","10.1016/0550-3213(92)90320-B",,"hep-th",,"  A new transverse lattice model of $3+1$ Yang-Mills theory is constructed by
introducing Wess-Zumino terms into the 2-D unitary non-linear sigma model
action for link fields on a 2-D lattice. The Wess-Zumino terms permit one to
solve the basic non-linear sigma model dynamics of each link, for discrete
values of the bare QCD coupling constant, by applying the representation theory
of non-Abelian current (Kac-Moody) algebras. This construction eliminates the
need to approximate the non-linear sigma model dynamics of each link with a
linear sigma model theory, as in previous transverse lattice formulations. The
non-perturbative behavior of the non-linear sigma model is preserved by this
construction. While the new model is in principle solvable by a combination of
conformal field theory, discrete light-cone, and lattice gauge theory
techniques, it is more realistically suited for study with a Tamm-Dancoff
truncation of excited states. In this context, it may serve as a useful
framework for the study of non-perturbative phenomena in QCD via analytic
techniques.

theories, are investigated in conjunction with the string black hole solution.
The angular variable in the Euclidean version, is found to have a double set of
winding. Region III is shown to be $SU(2)_k/U(1)$ where the doubling accounts
for the cut sructure of the parafermionic amplitudes and fits nicely across the
horizon and singularity. The implications for string thermodynamics and
identical particles correlations are discussed.
