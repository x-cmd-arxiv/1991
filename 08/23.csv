  Auhtor email gng@umdhep.umd.edu",,,,"hep-th",,"  The perturbations of string-theoretic black holes are analyzed by
generalizing the method of Chandrasekhar. Attention is focussed on the case of
the recently considered charged string-theoretic black hole solutions as a
representative example. It is shown that string-intrinsic effects greatly alter
the perturbed motions of the string-theoretic black holes as compared to the
perturbed motions of black hole solutions of the field equations of general
relativity, the consequences of which bear on the questions of the scattering
behavior and the stability of string-theoretic black holes. The explicit forms
of the axial potential barriers surrounding the string-theoretic black hole are
derived. It is demonstrated that one of these, for sufficiently negative values
of the asymptotic value of the dilaton field, will inevitably become negative
in turn, in marked contrast to the potentials surrounding the static black
holes of general relativity. Such potentials may in principle be used in some
cases to obtain approximate constraints on the value of the string coupling
constant. The application of the perturbation analysis to the case of
two-dimensional string-theoretic black holes is discussed.

Hermitian matrix model. Building on the work of Periwal and Shevitz and of
Nappi, we find an exact solution including all odd scaling operators, in terms
of a hierarchy of flows of $2\times 2$ matrices. We derive from it loop
equations which can be expressed as Virasoro constraints on the partition
function. We discover a ``pure topological"" phase of the theory in which all
correlation functions are determined by recursion relations. We also examine
macroscopic loop amplitudes, which suggest a relation to 2D gravity coupled to
dense polymers.

$U_q(s\ell(2))$ with $q= e^{2\pi i/N}$. These intertwiners serve to define the
Boltzmann weights of a lattice model, which shares some similarities with the
chiral Potts model. An alternative interpretation of these Boltzmann weights is
as scattering matrices of solitonic structures whose kinematics is entirely
governed by the quantum group. Finally, we consider the limit $N\to\infty$
where we find an infinite--dimensional representation of the braid group, which
may give rise to an invariant of knots and links.

four commuting translation generators, but only two (one for $ |q|=1$, second
