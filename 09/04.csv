(the revised version)","Int.J.Mod.Phys.A8:3945-3964,1993","10.1142/S0217751X93001600",,"hep-th",,"  We investigate the renormalization of N=2 SUSY L-G models with central charge
$c=3p/(2+p)$ perturbed by an almost marginal chiral operator. We calculate the
renormalization of the chiral fields up to $gg{^*}$ order and of nonchiral
fields up to $g(g^{*})$ order. We propose a formulation of the
nonrenormalization theorem and show that it holds in the lowest nontrivial
order. It turns out that, in this approximation, the chiral fields can not get
renormalized $\Phi^{k}=\Phi^{k}_{0}$. The $\beta$ function then remains
unchanged $\beta=\epsilon gr$.

bosonising the fermions, we then obtain realisations of $W_\infty$ in terms of
two scalars. Keeping the most non-linear terms in the scalars only, we arrive
at two-scalar realisations of classical $w_\infty$.

define a sensible ``bulk'' S -- matrix in critical (super) string theory in any
dimension, have a simple structure in two dimensional space time, due to
partial decoupling of a certain infinite set of discrete states. We also argue
that the general (non resonant) amplitudes are determined by the resonant ones,
and calculate them explicitly, finding an interesting analytic structure.
Finally, we discuss the space time interpretation of our results.
