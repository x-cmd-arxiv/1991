is independent of $d$ of the space time directions, and for which the gauge
field configuration lies in a subgroup that commutes with $p$ of the $U(1)$
generators of the gauge group, there is an $O(d)\otimes O(d+p)$ transformation,
which, acting on the solution, generates new classical solutions of the theory.
With the help of these transformations we construct black 6-brane solutions in
ten dimensional heterotic string theory carrying independent magnetic, electric
and antisymmetric tensor gauge field charge, by starting from a black 6-brane
solution that carries magnetic charge but no electric or antisymmetric tensor
gauge field charge. The electric and the magnetic charges point in different
directions in the gauge group.

superparticles, which enables us to construct higher order $\kappa$-invariant
actions. The method relies on a reformulation of these models as supersymmetric
sigma models that are invariant under local worldline superconformal
transformations. We show that the $\kappa$-symmetry is embedded in the
superconformal symmetry so that a calculus for the $\kappa$-symmetry is
equivalent to a tensor calculus for the latter. We develop such a calculus
without the introduction of a worldline supergravity multiplet.
