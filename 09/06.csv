condensation of Wilson lines. By expanding around an appropriate Wilson line
background, it is possible at large $N$ to analytically continue the confining
phase to arbitrarily high temperatures, reaching a weak coupling confinement
regime. This is used to study the high temperature partition function of an
$SU(N)$ electric flux tube. It is found that the partition function corresponds
to that of a string theory with a number of world-sheet fields that diverges at
short distance.

Polchinski and Strominger to superstrings. The Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz string is
different from the Green-Schwarz string in non-critical dimensions. Both are
anomaly-free and Poincare invariant. Some implications of the results are
discussed. The formal analogy with 4D (super)gravity is pointed out.

even super KP operator $\Lambda = \theta^{2} + \sum^{\infty}_{i=-2}U_{i}
\theta^{-i-1}$, as a supersymmetric extension of the ordinary KP bi-Hamiltonian
structure. It is expected to give rise to a universal super $W$-algebra
incorporating all known extended superconformal $W_{N}$ algebras by reduction.
We also construct the super BKP hierarchy by imposing a set of anti-self-dual
constraints on the super KP hierarchy.
