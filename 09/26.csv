into the ambient heat bath and so can acquire an effective lifetime. At high
temperatures and for weak couplings the inverse lifetime, or damping rate, for
energetic quarks and transverse gluons, (those whose momenta satisfy $|\p| \gg
gT$) is given by $\gamma(\p) = c\; g^2 \log\left({1\over g}\right)\; T +
O(g^2T)$. We show that very simple arguments suffice both to fix the numerical
coefficient, $c$, in this expression and to show that the $O(g^2T)$
contribution is incalculable in perturbation theory without further
assumptions. For QCD with $N_c$ colours we find (expressed in terms of the
casimir invariants $C_a=N_c$ and $C_f=(N_c^2-1)/(2N_c)$): $c_g=+{C_a\over
4\pi}$ for gluons and $c_q=+{C_f\over 4\pi}$ for quarks. These numbers agree
with the more detailed calculations of Pisarski \etal\ but disagree with those
of Lebedev and Smilga. The simplicity of the calculation also permits a direct
verification of the gauge-invariance and physical sign of the result.

Veerman","Dynamics of certain non-conformal degree two maps on the plane",,"Experimental Math, vol 2 issue 4 (1993), 281-300",,"Stony Brook IMS 1991/18","math.DS",,"  In this paper we consider maps on the plane which are similar to quadratic
maps in that they are degree 2 branched covers of the plane. In fact, consider
for $\alpha$ fixed, maps $f_c$ which have the following form (in polar
coordinates):
  $$f_c(r\,e^{i\theta})\;=\;r^{2\alpha}\,e^{2i\theta}\,+\,c$$
  When $\alpha=1$, these maps are quadratic ($z \maps z^2 + c$), and their
dynamics and bifurcation theory are to some degree understood. When $\alpha$ is
different from one, the dynamics is no longer conformal. In particular, the
dynamics is not completely determined by the orbit of the critical point.
Nevertheless, for many values of the parameter c, the dynamics has strong
similarities to that of the quadratic family. For other parameter values the
dynamics is dominated by 2 dimensional behavior: saddles and the like.
  The objects of study are Julia sets, filled-in Julia sets and the
connectedness locus. These are defined in analogy to the conformal case. The
main drive in this study is to see to what extent the results in the conformal
case generalize to that of maps which are topologically like quadratic maps
(and when $\alpha$ is close to one, close to being quadratic).
