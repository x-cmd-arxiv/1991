  gravity","9pp",,,,"hep-th",,"  Within the 4-dimensional conformal algebra, the presence of two translation
operators implies the existence of 3 distinct metrics of definite Weyl weight
constructible from the translational gauge fields. If we demand that each of
these metrics give rise to a gauge theory of gravity, we are led to extend the
symmetry so that each of these three metrics has a corresponding translation
operator. Assigning a vierbein to each of these three translations, a different
spacetime metric arises for every choice of inner product of the vierbeins. The
covering group of the compact part of the minimal transitive group classifying
these inner products is $SU(4)$. An additional $SU(2)$ symmetry classifies the
antisymmetric parts of the vierbein product. If the metric is chosen as the
gauge field of the translations in the standard way, the SU(4) part of this
symmetry is broken to the semidirect product of $SU(3)$ with $U(1)$.

expressed as a quadratic condition on the curvature of an $SU(2)$ (spin)
connection which is a covariant generalization of the self-dual Yang-Mills
equations. Local properties of the moduli space of self-dual Einstein
connections are described in the context of an elliptic complex which arises in
the linearization of the quadratic equations on the $SU(2)$ curvature. In
particular, it is shown that the moduli space is discrete when the cosmological
constant is positive; when the cosmological constant is negative the moduli
space can be a manifold the dimension of which is controlled by the
Atiyah-Singer index theorem.

functions that can be obtained with simple currents in theories with a center
(Z_p)^k with p prime. New empirical results for other centers are also
presented. Our observation that the total number of invariants is
monodromy-independent for (Z_p)^k appears to be true in general as well. (Talk

  may 20-25, Stony Brook.)",,,,"hep-th",,"  The Lagrangian Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism gives the rules for the
quantisation of a general class of gauge theories which contain all the
theories known up to now. It does, however, not only give a recipe to obtain a
gauge fixed action, but also gives a nice understanding of the mechanism behind
gauge fixing. It moreover brings together a lot of previous knowledge and
recipes in one main concept~: the canonical transformations. We explain the
essentials of this formalism and give related results on the superparticle.
Also anomalies (in general functions of fields and antifields) can be obtained
in this formalism, and it gives the relation between anomalies in different
gauges. A Pauli-Villars scheme can be used to obtain a regularised definition
of the expressions at the one loop level. The calculations become similar to
those of Fujikawa with the extra freedom of using arbitrary variables. A
discrepancy between anomalies in light-cone gauge of the Green-Schwarz
superstring and in the semi-light-cone gauge is discussed.

arbitrary discrete one-dimensional manifold. The existence of the continuum
limit is guaranteed if the target space is a Dynkin diagram of a simply laced
Lie algebra or its affine extension. In this case the theory can be mapped onto
the theory of strings embedded in the infinite discrete line $\Z$ which is the
target space of the SOS model. On the regular lattice this mapping is known as
Coulomb gas picture. ... Once the classical background is known, the amplitudes
involving propagation of strings can be evaluated by perturbative expansion
around the saddle point of the functional integral. For example, the partition
function of the noninteracting closed string (toroidal world sheet) is the
contribution of the gaussian fluctuations of the string field. The vertices in
the corresponding Feynman diagram technique are constructed as the loop
amplitudes in a random matrix model with suitably chosen potential.
