one-dimensional matrix model - believed to describe two-dimensional string
theory in a black-hole background which also allows for space-time foam - we
give a geometric interpretation of the fact that two-dimensional stringy black
holes are consistent with conventional quantum mechanics due to the infinite
gauged `W-hair' property that characterises them.

ghost sectors. Some of these operators may be viewed as the liouville dressings
of the energy operator of the Ising model coupled to {\it 2d~gravity} and this
fills in a gap in the connection between pure $W_3 -$gravity and Ising model
coupled to 2d gravity found in our previous work. We formulate a selection rule
required for the calculation of correlators in $W -$gravity theories. Using
this rule, we construct the non ghost part of the new operators of $W_N
-$gravity and find that they represent the $(N , N+1)$ minimal model operators
from both inside and outside the minimal table. Along the way we obtain the
canonical spectrum of $W_N -$gravity for all $N$ .

non-linear deformation of $W_{\infty}$, characterized by $k$. This is a
universal $W$-algebra which linearizes in the large $k$ limit and truncates to
$W_{N}$ for $k=-N$. Using the theory of non-compact parafermions we construct a
free field realization of the non-linear $W_{\infty}$ in terms of two bosons
with background charge. The $W$-characters of all unitary $SL(2,R)/U(1)$
representations are computed. Applications to the physics of 2-d black hole
backgrounds are also discussed and connections with the KP approach to $c=1$
string theory are outlined.
