transformation between the Chern-Simons and ADM versions of quantum gravity is
constructed explicitly, and the wave functions are compared. It is shown that
Chern-Simons wave functions correspond to modular forms of weight 1/2, that is,
spinors on the ADM moduli space, and that their evolution (in York's
``extrinsic time'' variable) is described by a Dirac equation. (This version
replaces paper 9109006, which was garbled by my mailer.)
