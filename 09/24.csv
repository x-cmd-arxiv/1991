B278 (1992) 79","10.1016/0370-2693(92)90714-F",,"hep-th",,"  We give a direct proof of the relation between vacuum singular vectors and
conservation laws for the quantum KdV equation or equivalently for
$\Phi_{(1,3)}$-perturbed conformal field theories. For each degree at which a
classical conservation law exists, we find a quantum conserved quantity for a
specific value of the central charge. Various generalizations ($N=1,2$
supersymmetric, Boussinesq) of this result are presented.

  Northeastern University, Boston, MA.)",,,,"hep-th",,"  Based on the assumption that the target space duality ($T\to 1/T$) is
preserved even nonperturbatively, the properties of static string vacua are
studied. A discussion of the effective four-dimensional supergravity action
based on target-space modular symmetry $SL(2,{\bf Z})$ is presented. The
nonperturbative superpotential removes the vacuum degeneracy with respect to
the compactification modulus ($T$) generically breaks supersymmetry with
negative cosmological constant. Charged matter fields get negative $(mass)^2$
signalling an additional instability of string vacuum and the blowing up of
orbifold singularities. In addition for a class of modularly invariant
potentials topologically stable stringy domain walls of nontrivial compaction
modulus field configuration are found. They are supersymmetric solutions, thus
saturating the Bogomolnyi bound. Their physical implications are discussed.

  Stony Brook, NY.)",,,,"hep-th",,"  We point out that the moduli sector of the $(2,2)$ string compactification
with its nonperturbatively preserved non-compact symmetries is a fertile
framework to study global topological defects, thus providing a natural source
for the large scale structure formation. Based on the target space modular
invariance of the nonperturbative superpotential of the four-dimensional N=1
supersymmetric string vacua, topologically stable stringy domain walls are
found. They are supersymmetric solutions, thus saturating the Bogomolnyi bound.
It is also shown that there are moduli sectors that allow for the global
monopole-type and texture-type configurations whose radial stability is ensured
by higher derivative terms.
