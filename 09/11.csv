the effective string, which rule out the ordinary bosonic string even with
short distance modifications. Allowing topological excitations, corresponding
to winding around the colour flux tube, produces at the quantum level a
universal free fermion string with a boundary phase nu=1/4. This coincides with
a model proposed some time ago in order to fit Monte Carlo data of 3D and 4D
Lattice gauge systems better. A universal value of the thickness of the colour
flux tube is predicted.

Kirillov brackets on the Kac-Moody algebra, and that they define a coordinated
system. Classical extended conformal algebras are obtained from the second
Poisson bracket. In particular, we construct the $W_n^l$ algebras, first
discussed for the case $n=3$ and $l=2$ by A. Polyakov and M. Bershadsky.

couple the model to the Liouville action and $c$ scalar fields and show,
treating the combined system as a non linear sigma model, that the resulting
theory can be interpreted as a critical string moving in a target space of
dimension $D=c+2$. We then analyse perturbatively a generalised model
containing a kinetic term and an arbitrary potential for the auxiliary field.
We use the background field method and work with covariant gauges. We show that
the renormalisability of the theory depends on the form of the potential. For a
general potential, the theory can be renormalised as a non linear sigma model.
In the particular case of a Liouville-like potential, the theory is
renormalisable in the usual sense.
