School in Theoretical Physics. The subject of these lectures is soliton
solutions of string theory. We construct a class of exact conformal field
theories possessing a spacetime soliton or instanton interpretation and present
a preliminary discussion of their physical properties.

schemes in which the light spectrum below the compactification scale is exactly
that of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. In the absence of string
threshold corrections the predicted values $\sin^2\theta _W=0.218$ and $\alpha
_s=0.20$ are in gross conflict with experiment, but these corrections are
generically important. One can express the string threshold corrections to
$\sin^2\theta _W$ and $\alpha_s$ in terms of certain $modular$ $weights$ of
quark, lepton and Higgs superfields as well as the $moduli$ of the string
model. We find that in order to get agreement with the experimental
measurements within the context of this $minimal$ scheme, certain constraints
on the $modular$ $weights$ of the quark, lepton and Higgs superfields should be
obeyed. Our analysis indicates that this $minimal$ $string$ $unification$

discrete linear systems. We see that the consistency conditions of the discrete
linear system lead to the Virasoro constraints. The linear system is endowed
with gauge invariances. We show that invariance under time-independent gauge
transformations entails the integrability of the model, while the double
scaling limit is connected with a time-dependent gauge transformation. We
derive the continuum version of the discrete linear system, we prove that the
partition function is actually the $\tau$-function of the KdV hierarchy and
that the linear system completely determines the Virasoro constraints.
