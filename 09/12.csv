stabilization of 2D quantum gravity and prove that it does not satisfy the KdV
flow equations. It therefore differs from a recently suggested matrix model
which allows real solutions to the KdV equations. The behaviour of the Fermi
energy, the free energy and macroscopic loops in the stochastic quantization
scheme are elucidated.

of a conformal field theory. We describe how a restriction of the q-deformed
$\hat{sl(2)}$ affine Lie algebra symmetry of the sine-Gordon theory can be used
to derive the S-matrices of the $\Phi^{(1,3)}$ perturbations of the minimal
unitary series. This analysis provides an identification of fields which create
the massive kink spectrum. We investigate the ultraviolet limit of the
restricted sine-Gordon model, and explain the relation between the restriction
and the Fock space cohomology of minimal models. We also comment on the
structure of degenerate vacuum states. Deformed Serre relations are proven for
arbitrary affine Toda theories, and it is shown in certain cases how relations
of the Serre type become fractional spin supersymmetry relations upon
restriction.

1+1-dimensional integrable models has been determined from the exact S-matrix.
It is shown here how to modify the boundary conditions to project out the
lowest-energy state, which enables one to find excited-state energies. This is
done by calculating thermodynamic expectation values of operators which
generate discrete symmetries. This is demonstrated with a number of perturbed
conformal field theories, including the Ising model, the three-state Potts
model, ${\bf Z}_n$ parafermions, Toda minimal S-matrices, and massless
Goldstinos.

conformal field theories. In particular we discuss how different conformal
field theories which are related by marginal or nearly marginal deformations

field theory. We also discuss construction of a classical solution labelled by
infinite number of parameters in string field theory in two dimensions. For a
specific set of values of the parameters the solution can be identified to the
black hole solution.
