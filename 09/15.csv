following from the string effective action are solved when the metric has only
time dependence. By taking one of the two space dimensions as compact, our
solution reproduces a recently discovered charged black hole solution in two
space-time dimensions. Solutions in presence of nonvanishing three dimensional
background antisymmetric tensor field are also discussed.
