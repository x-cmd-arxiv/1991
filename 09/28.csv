  in Theoretical Physics, June 3--7, 1991, at Baruch College, New York City","Phys. Lett. B263 (1991) 190-194",,,"hep-th",,"  We discuss three closely related questions; i)~Given a conformal field
theory, how may we deform it? ii)~What are the symmetries of string theory? and
iii)~Does string theory have free parameters? We show that there is a distinct
deformation of the stress tensor for every solution to the linearised covariant
equations of motion for the massless modes of the Bosonic string, and use this
result to discuss the symmetries of the string. We also find an additional
finite dimensional space of deformations which may correspond to free
parameters of string theory, or alternatively may be interpreted as topological
degrees of freedom, perhaps analogous to the isolated states found in two
dimensions.

relations containing either the S-matrix of a real coupling (simply-laced)
affine Toda field theory, or its minimal counterpart. One feature of the
construction is that the bootstrap relations for the S-matrices follow
automatically from those for the conserved quantities, via an algebraic
interpretation of the fusing of two particles to form a single bound state.
