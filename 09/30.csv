  Conformal Field Theory","21pp","Int.J.Mod.Phys. A7 (1992) 4949-4964","10.1142/S0217751X92002246",,"hep-th",,"  We investigate the possibility to construct extended parafermionic conformal
algebras whose generating current has spin $1+\frac{1}{K}$, generalizing the
superconformal (spin 3/2) and the Fateev Zamolodchikov (spin 4/3) algebras.
Models invariant under such algebras would possess $Z_K$ exotic supersymmetries
satisfying (supercharge)$^K$ = (momentum). However, we show that for $K=4$ this
new algebra allows only for models at $c=1$, for $K=5$ it is a trivial
rephrasing of the ordinary $Z_5$ parafermionic model, for $K=6,7$ (and,
requiring unitarity, for all larger $K$) such algebras do not exist.
Implications of this result for existence of exotic supersymmetry in two
dimensional field theory are discussed.
