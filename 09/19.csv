  Meeting held in Kyoto, Japan, June 24-29, 1991",,,,"hep-th",,"  A review is given of recent work on topology changing solutions to the first
order form of general relativity. These solutions have metrics which are smooth
everywhere, invertible almost everywhere, and have bounded curvature. The
importance of considering degenerate metrics is discussed, and the possibility
that quantum effects can suppress topology change is briefly examined.

embedded in two dimensions, and show that they are given by the structure
constants of the group of area preserving diffeomorphisms. We propose an
effective action for these states, which is itself invariant under this
infinite-dimensional group.
