renormalization group flow above two dimensions. This involves the construction
of a monotonically decreasing $c$-function using a spectral representation. The
missing step of the proof is a good definition of this function at the fixed
points. We argue that for all kinds of perturbative flows the $c$-function is
well-defined and the $c$-theorem holds in any dimension. We provide examples in
multicritical and multicomponent scalar theories for dimension $2<d<4$. We also
discuss the non-perturbative flows in the yet unsettled case of the $O(N)$
sigma-model for $2\leq d\leq 4$ and large $N$.

study of multi-critical multi-cut one-matrix models and their associated
$sl(2,C)$ integrable hierarchies, is further pursued. The double scaling limits
of hermitian matrix models with different scaling ans\""atze, lead, to the KdV
hierarchy, to the modified KdV hierarchy and part of the non-linear
Schr\""odinger hierarchy. Instead, the anti-hermitian matrix model, in the
two-arc sector, results in the Zakharov-Shabat hierarchy, which contains both
KdV and mKdV as reductions. For all the hierarchies, it is found that the
Virasoro constraints act on the associated tau-functions. Whereas it is known
that the ZS and KdV models lead to the Virasoro constraints of an $sl(2,C)$
vacuum, we find that the mKdV model leads to the Virasoro constraints of a
highest weight state with arbitrary conformal dimension.

discussed emphasizing the necessity to account for the dilaton dynamics for a
proper incorporation of ``large - small"" duality. This drastically modifies the
intuition one has with Einstein's gravity. For example winding modes, even
though contribute to energy density, oppose expansion and if not annihilated
will stop the expansion. Moreover we find that the radiation dominated era of
the standard cosmology emerges quite naturally in string cosmology. Our
analysis of non-critical string cosmology provides a reinterpretation of the
(universal cover of the) recently studied two dimensional black hole solution
as a conformal realization of cosmological solutions found previously by
Mueller.

gravity from strings compactified to four dimensions and find that it strongly
depends on the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking. We consider a general class
of string--inspired models which are good candidates for successful extended
inflation. In particular, the $\omega$--problem of ordinary extended inflation
is automatically solved by the production of only very small bubbles until the
end of inflation. We find that the inflaton field could belong either to the
untwisted or to the twisted massless sectors of the string spectrum, depending
on the supersymmetry breaking superpotential.
