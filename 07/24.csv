"math/9201230",,"Denny H. Leung","Banach spaces with Property (w)",,,,"Banach Archive 7/24/91","math.FA",,"  A Banach space E is said to have Property (w) if every (bounded linear)
operator from E into E' is weakly compact. We give some interesting examples of
James type Banach spaces with Property (w). We also consider the passing of
Property (w) from E to C(K,E).
