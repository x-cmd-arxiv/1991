"math/9201279","Mary Rees","Mary Rees","A partial description of the parameter space of rational maps of degree
  two: Part 2",,,,"Stony Brook IMS 1991/4","math.DS",,"  This continues the investigation of a combinatorial model for the variation
of dynamics in the family of rational maps of degree two, by concentrating on
those varieties in which one critical point is periodic. We prove some general
results about nonrational critically finite degree two branched coverings, and
finally identify the boundary of the rational maps in the combinatorial model,
thus completing the proofs of results announced in Part 1.
