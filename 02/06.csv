"math/9201223","Dale E. Alspach","Dale E. Alspach","Level sets and the uniqueness of measures",,,,"Banach Archive 2/5/91","math.FA",,"  A result of Nymann is extended to show that a positive $\sigma$-finite
measure with range an interval is determined by its level sets. An example is
given of two finite positive measures with range the same finite union of
intervals but with the property that one is determined by its level sets and
the other is not.
