"math/9201227","Gilles Pisier","Gilles Pisier","Remarks on complemented subspaces of von-Neumann algebras",,,,"Banach Archive 5/31/91","math.OA math.FA",,"  In this note we include two remarks about bounded ($\underline{not}$
necessarily contractive) linear projections on a von Neumann-algebra. We show
that if $M$ is a von Neumann-subalgebra of $B(H)$ which is complemented in B(H)
and isomorphic to $M \otimes M$ then $M$ is injective (or equivalently $M$ is
contractively complemented). We do not know how to get rid of the second
assumption on $M$. In the second part,we show that any complemented reflexive
subspace of a $C^*$- algebra is necessarily linearly isomorphic to a Hilbert
space.

ways in which these regions can be tiled by dominoes. Our main result is a
generating function that not only gives the number of domino tilings of the
Aztec diamond of order $n$ but also provides information about the orientation
of the dominoes (vertical versus horizontal) and the accessibility of one
tiling from another by means of local modifications. Several proofs of the
formula are given. The problem turns out to have connections with the
alternating sign matrices of Mills, Robbins, and Rumsey, as well as the square
ice model studied by Lieb.
