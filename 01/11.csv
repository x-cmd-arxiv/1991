  $C^{1+\alpha}$-Denjoy-Koebe distortion lemma",,,,"Stony Brook IMS 1991/1a","math.DS",,"  We prove a technical lemma, the $C^{1+\alpha }$-Denjoy-Koebe distortion
lemma, estimating the distortion of a long composition of a $C^{1+\alpha }$
one-dimensional mapping $f:M\mapsto M$ with finitely many, non-recurrent, power
law critical points. The proof of this lemma combines the ideas of the
distortion lemmas of Denjoy and Koebe.

  finite one-dimensional mappings",,,,"Stony Brook IMS 1991/1b","math.DS",,"  We study geometrically finite one-dimensional mappings. These are a subspace
of $C^{1+\alpha}$ one-dimensional mappings with finitely many, critically
finite critical points. We study some geometric properties of a mapping in this
subspace. We prove that this subspace is closed under quasisymmetrical
conjugacy. We also prove that if two mappings in this subspace are
topologically conjugate, they are then quasisymmetrically conjugate. We show
some examples of geometrically finite one-dimensional mappings.
