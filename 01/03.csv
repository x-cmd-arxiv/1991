Lorentz spaces. They have been studied by many authors, including Masty\l o,
Maligranda, and Kami\'nska. In this paper, we consider the problem of comparing
the Orlicz-Lorentz norms, and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for
them to be equivalent. As a corollary, we give necessary and sufficient
conditions for a Lorentz-Sharpley space to be equivalent to an Orlicz space,
extending results of Lorentz and Raynaud. We also give an example of a
rearrangement invariant space that is not an Orlicz-Lorentz space.
