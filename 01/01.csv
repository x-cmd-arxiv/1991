strong generators of a given perm group, together with a proof of correctness
and some notes about appropriate low-level data structures. Upper and lower
bounds on the running time are also obtained. (Following a suggestion of
Vaughan Pratt, we adopt the convention that perm $=$ permutation, perhaps
thereby saving millions of syllables in future research.)
